Both simple and highly integrated multiple systems are experiencing an extraordinary growth in the use of computers and software to monitor and/or control safety-critical subsystems or functions. A software specification error, design flaw, or the lack of generic safety-critical requirements can contribute to or cause a system failure or erroneous human decision. To achieve an acceptable level of safety for software used in critical applications, software system safety engineering must be given primary emphasis early in the requirements definition and system conceptual design process. Safety-critical software must then receive continuous management emphasis and engineering analysis throughout the development and operational lifecycles of the system.Software system safety is directly related to the more critical design aspects and safety attributes in software and system functionality, whereas software quality attributes are inherently different and require standard scrutiny and development rigor. Level of Rigor (LOR) is a graded approach to software quality and software design assurance as a pre-requisite that a suitable software process is followed for confidence. LOR concepts and standards such as DO-178C are NOT a substitute for software safety. Software safety per IEEE STD-1228 and MIL-STD-882E focuses on ensuring explicit safety requirements are met and verified using functional approaches from a safety requirements analysis and test perspective. Software safety hazard analysis required for more complex systems where software is controlling critical functions generally are in the following sequential categories and are conducted in phases as part of the system safety or safety engineering process: software safety requirements analysis; software safety design analyses (top level, detailed design and code level); software safety test analysis, and software safety change analysis. Once these 'functional' software safety analyses are completed the software engineering team will know where to place safety emphasis and what functional threads, functional paths, domains and boundaries to focus on when designing in software safety attributes to ensure correct functionality and to detect malfunctions, failures, faults and to implement a host of mitigation strategies to control hazards. Software security and various software protection technologies are similar to software safety attributes in the design to mitigate various types of threats vulnerability and risks. Deterministic software is sought in the design by verifying correct and predictable behavior at the system level.",What's important for me to know about the safety of smart garage door openers?,train,"[[0.9282839894294739, 0.07171599566936493], [0.9483148455619812, 0.051685161888599396], [0.9156792163848877, 0.08432074636220932], [0.9001973867416382, 0.09980260580778122], [0.8843770623207092, 0.11562293022871017], [0.9677183032035828, 0.03228170797228813], [0.9381459951400757, 0.06185401603579521], [0.9277952909469604, 0.07220468670129776], [0.9385054707527161, 0.061494503170251846], [0.8788354992866516, 0.12116452306509018], [0.9464291930198669, 0.05357080698013306], [0.9494863152503967, 0.05051371455192566]]","[[1.4070342779159546, -1.1535896062850952], [1.5806145668029785, -1.3289014101028442], [1.3218330144882202, -1.0632051229476929], [1.2221308946609497, -0.9772889018058777], [1.1363046169281006, -0.8982446193695068], [1.835229516029358, -1.5652105808258057], [1.490571141242981, -1.2285574674606323], [1.4044252634048462, -1.1488807201385498], [1.4834364652633667, -1.2419042587280273], [1.1259506940841675, -0.8554977178573608], [1.5690137147903442, -1.3026782274246216], [1.6009331941604614, -1.3327429294586182]]",0.12116452306509018,0.07301928320278724

Chamberlain claims that the rolling code system makes it unlikely for a burglar to send a valid signal by replaying the recorded one.  With rolling code protection, a garage door will open if and only if the transmitted code is not among the last 1024 used codes and it is among the next 4096 codes.

When Mike Stephenson, an analyst at a computer hardware manufacture, took maintainership of Hacks code, he took the opportunity to improve upon it along with suggestions for game improvements from Izchak Miller, a philosophy professor at University of Pennsylvania, and Janet Walz, another computer hacker. Calling themselves the DevTeam, they began to make major modifications to Hacks code.  They named their new version NetHack, in part for the collaboration of the game over USENET. NetHacks major deviations from Hack were the introduction of a wider variety of monsters, borrowing from other mythologies and lores, including anachronistic and contemporary cultural elements (such as a tourist class with a flash-bulb camera inspired by Terry Pratchett's Discworld series) in the high fantasy setting, and the use of pre-defined levels with some procedural elements that the player would encounter deeper in the dungeons. Further iterations of the game included branching pathways through the dungeon and optional character-based quests that could grant the player an extremely useful item to complete the game. Though the DevTeam released the code publicly, they carefully maintained who could contribute to the code base to avoid excessive forking of the vanilla game, and remain relatively quiet about suggested improvements to each release, working in relatively secrecy from its player base.

All EU member states are party to both organisations through international treaties. The Treaty on European Union article 6(2) required the EU to accede to the ECHR, but would 'not affect the Union's competences as defined in the Treaties'. This was thought necessary before the Treaty of Lisbon 2007 to ensure that the EU gave adequate protection to human rights, overseen by the external European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. However, in Opinion 2/13, after a request by the Commission to review their plan to accede, the Court of Justice (in Luxembourg) produced a five main reasons why it felt that the accession agreement as it stood was incompatible with the treaties. The reasoning was regarded by a majority of commentators as thinly veiled attempt of the Court of Justice to clutch onto its own power, but it has meant the Commission is redrafting a new accession agreement. Under TEU articles 3(5), 21, 34 and 42, the EU must also respect the principles of the United Nations Charter. After the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution to freeze the assets of suspected terrorists, linked to Osama Bin Laden. This included a Saudi national, Mr Kadi. Sweden froze his assets pursuant to an EU Regulation, which gave effect to the UN Security Council resolution. In Kadi v Commission, Mr Kadi claimed there was no evidence that he was connected to terrorism, and he had not had a fair trial: a fundamental human right. The opinion of AG Maduro recalled Aharon Barak, of the Supreme Court of Israel, that it 'is when the cannons roar that we especially need the laws'. The Court of Justice held that even UN member cannot contravene 'the principles that form part of the very community legal order'. In effect the EU has developed a rule that within the boundaries of certain jus cogens principles, other courts may take primacy. The content of those core principles remains open to ongoing judicial dialogue among the senior courts in Europe.",What are the GMO food labeling rules in the EU?,train,"[[0.9711544513702393, 0.02884557656943798], [0.9796608686447144, 0.020339058712124825], [0.9596651792526245, 0.040334854274988174], [0.9786688089370728, 0.021331166848540306], [0.9749491810798645, 0.025050820782780647], [0.9797159433364868, 0.02028411254286766], [0.8778197765350342, 0.1221802830696106], [0.9919683337211609, 0.008031671866774559], [0.9891379475593567, 0.010862062685191631], [0.983178973197937, 0.01682095415890217], [0.9905869364738464, 0.009413114748895168], [0.9744464755058289, 0.02555353380739689], [0.9885913729667664, 0.011408595368266106], [0.8297218084335327, 0.1702781617641449], [0.9250679612159729, 0.07493200898170471]]","[[1.899915337562561, -1.616613507270813], [2.0830960273742676, -1.7915672063827515], [1.726270079612732, -1.4430984258651733], [2.0592126846313477, -1.7668112516403198], [1.9715839624404907, -1.6898947954177856], [2.0908854007720947, -1.7865394353866577], [1.155859112739563, -0.8160845041275024], [2.5353167057037354, -2.28098201751709], [2.3949806690216064, -2.116576910018921], [2.1653971672058105, -1.9027684926986694], [2.4613938331604004, -2.1947996616363525], [1.9660331010818481, -1.6750608682632446], [2.373589277267456, -2.088324546813965], [0.9790696501731873, -0.6045874953269958], [1.4026634693145752, -1.110622763633728]]",0.1702781617641449,0.04037773174544176

In a role-based access control system, a role provides access rights to a set of resources. A user can own multiple roles, and he has permission to access all resources granted by some of his roles. Also, a role can be owned by multiple users. The role mining problem is to find a minimum set of roles, such that for each user, his roles taken together grant access to all specified resources.

Fingerprint brushes, for example, can retain the DNA they pick up and create contaminated evidence. In order to ensure there will not be a transfer of DNA on brushes, they should not be reused. Each scene should get a new one. This tip is especially important in situations like homicide cases, where DNA is a crucial factor. Paying the extra six to nine dollars for an extra brush may be the difference in contaminated evidence and alleviating questions. Gloves are another tool that need to be carefully handled in a crime scene. There is no guarantee that gloves will permit contamination. The key is to change gloves often.

Items are worded so participants would respond whether or not they felt they could accomplish a certain task (yes or no). The second type is self-efficacy strength.

They indicated that initial studies might be done in Caenorhabditis elegans, followed by Drosophila, because of their comparatively simple neural circuits. Mid-term studies could be done in zebrafish, mice, and the Etruscan shrew, with studies ultimately to be done in primates and humans. They proposed the development of nanoparticles that could be used as voltage sensors that would detect individual action potentials, as well as nanoprobes that could serve as electrophysiological multielectrode arrays. In particular, they called for the use of wireless, noninvasive methods of neuronal activity detection, either utilizing microelectronic very-large-scale integration, or based on synthetic biology rather than microelectronics. In one such proposed method, enzymatically produced DNA would serve as a 'ticker tape record' of neuronal activity, based on calcium ion-induced errors in coding by DNA polymerase.

Timon and Pumbaa, afraid that Nala would take away their friend, attempted to spoil Simba and Nala's date by letting out bees, a spider, and tripping the two (explaining why they fell down the hill in the first film), but all failed. Later on, they see Simba and Nala quarrelling. They also mistake the appearance of Mufasa's ghost as bad weather ('I think the storm is coming to a head'). After they realize Simba has gone back to take his rightful place as king, it is revealed that Pumbaa had set off to help Simba before Timon, who was indifferent and reluctant. Timon eventually came to his senses thanks to Rafiki's continued advice, and quickly followed, after which Rafiki says, 'My work here is done.' After providing their hula distraction (shown in the first film. This apparently was Timon's fault because before he did the dance, he asked Simba what his (Simba) plan was to get past the hyenas, Simba replying 'Live bait.' When Timon realizes he and Pumbaa were the live bait, he sarcastically asked Simba 'What do you want me to do? Dress in drag and do the hula?'. A few seconds later, the hyenas wake up and see Timon in a hula skirt, a flower, and a flower necklace and Pumbaa like a cooked pig), the two run into Ma and Uncle Max, who had been searching for Timon ever since he left the meerkat colony. Later on during the fight, they defeated the hyenas by digging a massive tunnel network, sending the hyenas down Pride Rock where they get to take revenge on Scar who had betrayed them. This scene explains what happened to Timon and Pumbaa while Simba is fighting Scar. After Scar is killed in the first film and this film, Timon and Pumbaa show up alive and unharmed against the hyenas that chased them, suggesting to audiences that they have either outsmarted or beat up the hyenas in the first film.

Although female worker bees do possess ovaries and can essentially produce viable eggs, this potential is almost never realized as long as the colony is ruled by a dominant queen. Therefore, the probability of personal reproduction by a worker bee is exceedingly low. “Worker policing,” which is the mutual prevention of reproduction by workers, could be the reason behind the conscious non-reproduction of female worker bees. In other words, their fertility is controlled by queen signals. The queen honeybee informs workers of her presence by pheromones that she secretes from her mandibular glands. These signals are acquired by workers in close vicinity of the queen and then spread to other workers in the colony, mainly by body contacts.

The approach being taken in UK beekeeping is to raise the profile of integrated bee health management, in other words identifying and trying to eliminate factors which reduce the health status of a colony. This incorporates increasing the skill level of beekeepers through training and education, raising the profile of habitat destruction and its effect of forage (nectar and pollen) availability, and of course research on the incidence and distribution of diseases and conditions in the UK together with more applied research and development on providing solutions.'",What would happen if the bees died out?,test,"[[0.35578498244285583, 0.6442150473594666], [0.6134122014045715, 0.38658782839775085], [0.9513092637062073, 0.04869072884321213], [0.2552603483200073, 0.7447396516799927], [0.44636452198028564, 0.5536354780197144], [0.5714172124862671, 0.4285827577114105]]","[[-0.1933334767818451, 0.4003725051879883], [0.32978731393814087, -0.13189074397087097], [1.651634931564331, -1.3207156658172607], [-0.38757485151290894, 0.6831758618354797], [0.006734239868819714, 0.22210478782653809], [0.23198302090168, -0.05565272644162178]]",0.7447396516799927,0.46774191533525783

In 2006, U.S. commercial migratory beekeepers reported sharp declines in their honey bee colonies. Such declines had happened in the past; however unlike the case in previous losses, adult bees were abandoning their hives. Scientists named this phenomenon colony collapse disorder (CCD). Reports show that beekeepers in most states have been affected by CCD.  Although no single factor has been identified as causing CCD, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in their progress report on CCD stated that CCD may be 'a syndrome caused by many different factors, working in combination or synergistically.'

The capital asset pricing model, first developed by Jack L. Treynor and William F. Sharpe, suggests that investors should fully diversify and their portfolios should be a mixture of the 'market' and a risk-free investment. Investors with different risk/return goals can use leverage to increase the ratio of the market return to the risk-free return in their portfolios. However, Richard Roll argued that this model was incorrect, because investors cannot invest in the entire market. This implies there should be demand for instruments that open up new types of investment opportunities (since this gets investors closer to being able to buy the entire market), but not for instruments that merely repackage existing risks (since investors already have as much exposure to those risks in their portfolio).",What are the risks of investing in startups?,train,"[[0.6555289030075073, 0.3444710969924927], [0.9504495859146118, 0.04955041781067848], [0.9403218030929565, 0.05967821553349495], [0.7632378935813904, 0.23676210641860962], [0.6047540903091431, 0.39524590969085693]]","[[0.43537503480911255, -0.20805713534355164], [1.617390751838684, -1.336553692817688], [1.5241940021514893, -1.2330611944198608], [0.8002108931541443, -0.3703029751777649], [0.3068910837173462, -0.11842263489961624]]",0.39524590969085693,0.21714154928922652

Alonso qualified 3rd, 3 tenths off the pole, and Massa qualified 6th, which was the best result for Ferrari in 2012 up to date. Race started well for Ferrari with Massa immediately pushing hard for positions, but eventually he made a mistake and spun, so that ruined his race. He finished 10th. Alonso was saving tires and it paid off when Sebastian Vettel pitted. Alonso came into the pits 2 laps later, which allowed him to take the second position. At the second round of pit stops, Hamilton went first to the pits, but both Alonso and Vettel were not set to do the same, and tried to finish the race without pitting. But that strategy was false for both of them, because tyres started to degrade very fast so cars behind were closing and closing and eventually started to attacking Fernando for position.

Lamborghini wanted the engine to have a similar displacement to Ferrari's 3-litre V12; however, he wanted the engine to be designed purely for road use, in contrast to the modified racing engines used by Ferrari in its road cars. Autostar was led by Giotto Bizzarrini, a member of the 'Gang of Five' of Ferrari engineers, who had been responsible for creating the famous Ferrari 250 GTO, but left the company in 1961 after founder Enzo Ferrari announced his intention to reorganize the engineering staff. The engine Bizzarrini designed, known today as the Lamborghini V12, had a displacement of 3.5 litres, a 9.5:1 compression ratio, and a maximum output of 360 bhp at 9800 rpm. Lamborghini was displeased with the engine's high revolutions and dry-sump lubrication system, both characteristic of the racing engines he specifically did not wish to use; when Bizzarrini refused to change the engine's design to make it more 'well-mannered', Lamborghini refused to pay the agreed-upon fee of 4.5 million Italian lire (plus a bonus for every unit of brake horsepower the engine could produce over the equivalent Ferrari engine). Lamborghini did not fully compensate the designer until ordered to do so by the courts, a terrific irony considering variants of Bizzarrini's V12 design were used by Lamborghini automobiles for nearly half a century, from 1963 to 2010.",Interesting.

The options at truck stops are generally high calorie and high fat foods available through restaurants, fast-food, diners and vending machines. Fresh produce and whole grain items are few and far between. Though 85% of mini-mart items are categorized as extremely unhealthy, 80% of these meals are considered a truck driver’s main meal of the day. Also, most of the foods carried by drivers in their trucks, whether or not stored in a refrigerator, are purchased from truck stops. Research suggests that drivers value quality and taste much more than nutrition when selecting food. Another issue is the pattern of extensive and irregular snacking while on the road and consumption of one large meal at the end of day.

It was one of a few completely temporary venues, which was removed following the completion of both the 2002 Winter Olympics and 2002 Winter Paralympics. The site of the Medals Plaza is a parking lot owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and is often used for temporary events. The Church donated free use of the property for the 2002 games, along with $5 million to transform the parking lot into an Olympic class Medals Plaza. On August 11, 1999, the same day the plaza's location was announced, a tornado hit downtown Salt Lake City killing one man at the site of the future plaza.

Along with Soldier Hollow, and the Utah Olympic Park it was built specifically for the 2002 Winter Olympics. On October 5, 1992 the Utah Sports Authority chose the Oquirrh Park Fitness Center in Kearns as the site for the 2002 Olympic Oval, beating out other locations in West Valley City, Sandy and downtown Salt Lake City. Funds from the 1989 Olympic referendum would be used to construct the oval, and would be repaid with profits from the games. The plans called to use $3.7 million of tax payer money to construct the oval, which would be an outdoor facility. Then if Salt Lake City won its 1995 bid for the 2002 games, Olympic revenues would be used to cover the oval, and build an ice sheet in the center of the track. By the time the groundbreaking ceremony was held in May 1994, the price tag had increased to $4.1 million, with an expected completion date sometime that December. Because of cold temperatures and a wet spring, cement for the oval could not be poured, and the oval didn't open until September 1, 1995, almost a year behind schedule. The oval was formally dedicated in a ceremony, attended by Olympian Cathy Turner, on January 12, 1996.

William Makepeace Thackeray snarked that it was enjoyed for 'enabling the many ladies amongst us who had beauty to display their charms, and the fewer number who had cleverness, to exhibit their wit'. In his Vanity Fair, the height of Rebecca Sharp's social success is brought on by her performances of acting charades before the Prince Regent. The first scene—'first two syllables'—displays a Turkish lord dealing with a slaver and his odalisque before being garroted by the sultan's chief black eunuch; the second—'last two syllables'—finds a Turk, his consort, and his black slave praying at sunrise when an enormous Egyptian head enters and begins singing. The answer—Agamemnon—is then acted out by Becky's husband, while she makes her (first) appearance as Clytemnestra. After refreshments, another round begins, partially in pantomime: the first scene shows a household yawningly finishing a game of cribbage and preparing for bed; the second opens on the household bustling with activity as daybreak prompts bells ringing, arguments over receipts, collection of the chamber pots, calls for carriages, and greetings to new guests; the third closes with a ship's crew and passengers tossed about by a storm with strong winds. The answer—nightingale—is then (somewhat mistakenly) acted out by Becky in the role of a singing French marquise, recalling both Lacoste's 1705 tragic opera Philomèle and an arriviste lover and wife of Louis XIV.

In this way, The Storyteller can be seen as a work of metafiction on a self-aware level in the author's chapters and on an unconscious level in the Storyteller's chapters. Throughout the novel, both the author and the Storyteller question what it means to tell stories and why they are important. This is done through  the questioning of the many different stories told in the novel. The stories Saúl tells the author, the stories the Storyteller tells the audience, and even the memories narrated by the author are questioned by the author as being inaccurate and heavily dependent on who is telling it.

It restored  the Ottoman constitution of 1876 and brought in multi-party politics with a two-stage electoral system (electoral law) under the Ottoman parliament. The constitution offered hope by freeing the empire’s citizens to modernize the state’s institutions, rejuvenate its strength, and enable it to hold its own against outside powers.  Its guarantee of liberties promised to dissolve inter-communal tensions and transform the empire into a more harmonious place. Instead, this period became the story of the twilight struggle of the Empire. Young Turks movement members once underground (named committee, group, etc.) established (declared) their parties. Among them “Committee of Union and Progress,” and “Freedom and Accord Party” were major parties.

The first extant account of Ottoman history ever written was produced by the poet Ahmedi, originally meant to be presented to Sultan Bayezid I but, following the latter's death in 1402, written for his son Süleyman Çelebi instead. This work, entitled the İskendernāme, ('The Book of Alexander') was part of a genre known as 'mirror for princes' (naṣīḥatnāme), meant to provide advice and guidance to the ruler with regard to statecraft. Thus rather than providing a factual account of the dynasty's history, Ahmedi's goal was to indirectly criticize the sultan by depicting his ancestors as model rulers, in contrast to the perceived deviance of Bayezid. Specifically, Ahmedi took issue with Bayezid's military campaigns against fellow Muslims in Anatolia, and thus depicted his ancestors as totally devoted to holy war against the Christian states of the Balkans.",What was the role of storytellers in the culture of the Ottoman Empire?,train,"[[0.8316193222999573, 0.1683807224035263], [0.9033171534538269, 0.09668277949094772], [0.9205744862556458, 0.07942556589841843], [0.9372855424880981, 0.06271447241306305], [0.9725717306137085, 0.027428314089775085]]","[[0.9330143332481384, -0.664132833480835], [1.2566090822219849, -0.9780293703079224], [1.35666024684906, -1.093517541885376], [1.4985675811767578, -1.2058281898498535], [1.9281784296035767, -1.6401894092559814]]",0.1683807224035263,0.08692637085914612

The starting date is conventionally held to be 24 April 1915, the day that Ottoman authorities rounded up, arrested, and deported 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders from Constantinople to Ankara, the majority of whom were eventually murdered.The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly, and the infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre. Other indigenous and Christian ethnic groups such as the Assyrians and the Ottoman Greeks were similarly targeted for extermination by the Ottoman government in the Assyrian genocide and the Greek genocide, and their treatment is considered by some historians to be part of the same genocidal policy.

The concept of the British Empire is a construct and was never a legal entity, unlike the Roman or other European empires. There was no imperial constitution, no office of emperor, no uniformity of laws. So when it began, when it ended, and what stages it went through is a matter of opinion, not official orders or laws. The dividing line was Britain's shift in the 1763-93 period from emphasis on Western to Eastern territories following U.S. independence. The London bureaucracy governing the colonies also changed, policies to white settler colonies changed and slavery was phased out.The first major history was The Expansion of England (1883), by Sir John Seeley. It was a bestseller for decades, and was widely admired by the imperialistic faction in British politics, and opposed by the anti-imperialists of the Liberal Party.  The book points out how and why Britain gained the colonies, the character of the Empire, and the light in which it should be regarded. It was well written and persuasive.  Seeley argued that British rule is in India's best interest. He also warned that India had to be protected and vastly increased the responsibilities and dangers to Britain. The book contains the much-quoted statement that 'we seem, as it were, to have conquered half the world in a fit of absence of mind'. Expansion of England appeared at an opportune time, and did much to make the British regard the colonies as an expansion of the British state as well as of British nationality, and to confirm to them the value of Britain's empire in the East.  In his history of the British Empire, written in 1940, A. P. Newton lamented that Seeley 'dealt in the main with the great wars of the eighteenth century and this gave the false impression that the British Empire has been founded largely by war and conquest, an idea that was unfortunately planted firmly in the public mind, not only in Great Britain, but also in foreign countries'.",Why did the British continue the confessional millet system from the Ottoman Empire?,train,"[[0.9685030579566956, 0.031496983021497726], [0.8686415553092957, 0.13135842978954315], [0.9792366027832031, 0.020763352513313293], [0.869273841381073, 0.1307261884212494], [0.9354938268661499, 0.06450614333152771], [0.9455024003982544, 0.05449756234884262], [0.9368607401847839, 0.06313924491405487], [0.9028474688529968, 0.09715248644351959], [0.9588234424591064, 0.041176628321409225], [0.9337467551231384, 0.06625326722860336], [0.907480001449585, 0.09252002090215683], [0.9803282618522644, 0.01967179961502552], [0.8354837894439697, 0.16451628506183624], [0.8977154493331909, 0.1022844985127449]]","[[1.862043023109436, -1.563816785812378], [1.1049953699111938, -0.7840055823326111], [2.0723860263824463, -1.7811979055404663], [1.1314386129379272, -0.7631145715713501], [1.4604495763778687, -1.2138645648956299], [1.5688773393630981, -1.284683108329773], [1.4735429286956787, -1.2236491441726685], [1.253733515739441, -0.9755383729934692], [1.7235684394836426, -1.4242676496505737], [1.4528383016586304, -1.1928820610046387], [1.2695471048355103, -1.0136994123458862], [2.1073110103607178, -1.8013904094696045], [0.9577573537826538, -0.6672440767288208], [1.2118475437164307, -0.9602474570274353]]",0.16451628506183624,0.0771473493160946

Slavery was a legal institution in all of the 13 American colonies and Canada (acquired by Britain in 1763). The profits of the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to 5% of the British economy at the time of the Industrial Revolution. The Somersett's case in 1772 was generally taken at the time to have decided that the condition of slavery did not exist under English law in England. In 1785, English poet William Cowper wrote: 'We have no slaves at home – Then why abroad? Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs receive our air, that moment they are free. They touch our country, and their shackles fall. That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud. And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then, And let it circulate through every vein.' In 1807, following many years of lobbying by the abolitionist movement, led primarily by William Wilberforce, the British Parliament voted to make the slave trade illegal anywhere in the Empire with the Slave Trade Act 1807. Thereafter Britain took a prominent role in combating the trade, and slavery itself was abolished in the British Empire with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. Between 1808 and 1860, the West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard. Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade. Atinkoye, the 11th Oba of Lagos, is famous for having used British involvement to regain his rule in return for suppressing slavery among the Yoruba people of Lagos in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers. In 1839, the world's oldest international human rights organization, Anti-Slavery International, was formed in Britain by Joseph Sturge, which worked to outlaw slavery in other countries.",Why did the British continue the confessional millet system from the Ottoman Empire?,train,"[[0.908048689365387, 0.0919514000415802], [0.9854738712310791, 0.014526129700243473], [0.9577512741088867, 0.04224874824285507], [0.9848789572715759, 0.015121053904294968], [0.9762317538261414, 0.023768242448568344], [0.9648771286010742, 0.0351228304207325], [0.9801145195960999, 0.019885513931512833], [0.974279522895813, 0.025720488280057907], [0.9575742483139038, 0.04242571443319321], [0.7994428277015686, 0.200557142496109], [0.9319694638252258, 0.06803048402070999], [0.9104563593864441, 0.08954362571239471], [0.9856147766113281, 0.014385153539478779], [0.9426591396331787, 0.05734086409211159], [0.8480306267738342, 0.15196938812732697], [0.9901783466339111, 0.009821578860282898], [0.9746515154838562, 0.025348462164402008]]","[[1.258508563041687, -1.0315293073654175], [2.237870693206787, -1.9793027639389038], [1.6995011568069458, -1.421512246131897], [2.232603073120117, -1.943827509880066], [2.0069022178649902, -1.7084475755691528], [1.7964240312576294, -1.5167255401611328], [2.094252347946167, -1.8034255504608154], [1.9690234661102295, -1.6653867959976196], [1.6899974346160889, -1.426651120185852], [0.9043222665786743, -0.4784935712814331], [1.4246561527252197, -1.19268798828125], [1.2848581075668335, -1.0343618392944336], [2.235936164855957, -1.9911329746246338], [1.5274622440338135, -1.2722290754318237], [1.0038442611694336, -0.7153934240341187], [2.436282157897949, -2.177020788192749], [1.96364426612854, -1.6857175827026367]]",0.200557142496109,0.054574518847991436

As such, professional historians recognize the revisionist practice of historical negationism as the work of 'truth-seekers' finding different truths in the historical record to fit their political, social, and ideological contexts.",What is the historical importance of the confessional millet system in the development of national identities?,train,"[[0.3561471104621887, 0.6438528299331665], [0.3517177700996399, 0.6482822895050049], [0.8753120303153992, 0.12468793988227844], [0.9088882803916931, 0.09111175686120987], [0.9137864708900452, 0.08621353656053543], [0.8528254628181458, 0.14717456698417664]]","[[-0.18041366338729858, 0.411712646484375], [-0.16031275689601898, 0.45118439197540283], [1.1217765808105469, -0.8269896507263184], [1.289655327796936, -1.0104800462722778], [1.326077938079834, -1.0346916913986206], [1.024687647819519, -0.7322478294372559]]",0.6482822895050049,0.290220486621062

The region of Africa Spinosaurus is preserved in dates from 112 to 97 million years ago. A 1996 study concluded from Moroccan fossils that Spinosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus, and Deltadromeus 'ranged across north Africa during the late Cretaceous (Cenomanian).' Those Spinosaurus that lived in the Bahariya Formation of what is now Egypt may have contended with shoreline conditions on tidal flats and channels, living in mangrove forests alongside similarly large dinosaurian predators Bahariasaurus and Carcharodontosaurus, the titanosaur sauropods Paralititan and Aegyptosaurus, crocodylomorphs, bony and cartilaginous fish, turtles, lizards, and plesiosaurs. In the dry season it might have resorted to preying on pterosaurs. This situation resembles that in the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of North America, which boasts up to five theropod genera over one tonne in weight, as well as several smaller genera (Henderson, 1998; Holtz et al., 2004).

The result is a strong preference for prey which are common in the environment and a weak preference for prey which are rare. The definition of preference will therefore impact on understanding switching. The most common definition of preference is the relationship between the ratio of prey in the environment and the ratio of prey in a predator's diet.

He set up a controlled experiment using oranges, which the prey fed on, as the spatially structured habitat in which the predator and prey would interact. At first, Huffaker experienced difficulties similar to those of Gause in creating a stable predator–prey interaction. By using oranges only, the prey species quickly became extinct followed consequently with predator extinction. However, he discovered that by modifying the spatial structure of the habitat, he could manipulate the population dynamics and allow the overall survival rate for both species to increase. He did this by altering the distance between the prey and oranges (their food), establishing barriers to predator movement, and creating corridors for the prey to disperse. These changes resulted in increased habitat patches and in turn provided more areas for the prey to seek temporary protection. When the prey would become extinct locally at one habitat patch, they were able to reestablish by migrating to new patches before being attacked by predators. This habitat spatial structure of patches allowed for coexistence between the predator and prey species and promoted a stable population oscillation model. Although the term metapopulation had not yet been coined, the environmental factors of spatial heterogeneity and habitat patchiness would later describe the conditions of a metapopulation relating to how groups of spatially separated populations of species interact with one another. Huffaker's experiment is significant because it showed how metapopulations can directly affect the predator–prey interactions and in turn influence population dynamics.",Where is the Venus flytrap native to?,train,"[[0.9923261404037476, 0.007673829793930054], [0.9935374855995178, 0.006462472956627607], [0.9908658862113953, 0.009134139865636826], [0.9939143061637878, 0.00608570221811533], [0.9950809478759766, 0.004919008351862431], [0.9945448637008667, 0.00545515725389123], [0.9942741990089417, 0.005725809372961521], [0.9768518805503845, 0.023148182779550552], [0.9941380023956299, 0.00586201436817646], [0.991877555847168, 0.008122503757476807], [0.9944191575050354, 0.005580867175012827]]","[[2.5551629066467285, -2.3070733547210693], [2.637200117111206, -2.398059606552124], [2.473222255706787, -2.2133378982543945], [2.666685104370117, -2.4290239810943604], [2.7542080879211426, -2.555509328842163], [2.7112245559692383, -2.4944992065429688], [2.700273275375366, -2.4567558765411377], [2.020857810974121, -1.7215608358383179], [2.6872398853302, -2.4461426734924316], [2.514244556427002, -2.2907166481018066], [2.7078566551208496, -2.4749581813812256]]",0.023148182779550552,0.008015426172112877

Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit.  Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell. In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example, eat millions of microscopic plankton at once, the prey being broken down well after entering the whale. Seed predation and egg predation are other forms of true predation, as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms. Predators of this classification need not eat prey entirely. For example, some predators cannot digest bones, while others can. Some may eat only part of an organism, as in grazing (see below), but still consistently cause its direct death.",How do Venus flytraps attract and catch their prey?,validation,"[[0.9635492563247681, 0.036450691521167755], [0.8857729434967041, 0.11422710120677948], [0.8201156854629517, 0.17988437414169312], [0.8025617599487305, 0.19743826985359192], [0.8951206803321838, 0.10487935692071915], [0.7566835880279541, 0.2433164417743683], [0.8030372858047485, 0.19696274399757385], [0.8742969036102295, 0.1257030963897705], [0.8939757347106934, 0.10602428764104843], [0.9475681781768799, 0.05243184044957161], [0.8508198261260986, 0.14918015897274017], [0.8272005915641785, 0.17279937863349915], [0.883971095085144, 0.11602886766195297]]","[[1.782918095588684, -1.491745114326477], [1.1636699438095093, -0.8846023082733154], [0.9335325956344604, -0.5835984945297241], [0.8768479228019714, -0.5255348682403564], [1.2031327486038208, -0.9410151839256287], [0.7581906318664551, -0.37639176845550537], [0.8930243849754333, -0.5123621821403503], [1.112958312034607, -0.8265390396118164], [1.195482611656189, -0.9365277290344238], [1.583795189857483, -1.3105896711349487], [1.0424044132232666, -0.698641300201416], [0.9592578411102295, -0.6066581010818481], [1.1533663272857666, -0.8772189617156982]]",0.2433164417743683,0.13810204685880587

The search image hypothesis proposes that an individual's sensory system becomes better able to detect a specific prey phenotype after recent experience with that same phenotype. It is clear that plant-pollinator interactions differ from predator-prey relationships, as it is beneficial to both the plant and animal for the pollinator to locate the plant. However, it has been suggested that cognitive constraints on short-term memory capabilities may limit pollinators from identifying and handling more than one floral type at a time, making plant-pollinator relationships theoretically similar to predator-prey relationships in regards to the ability to identify food sources. Although plant traits that have evolved to attract pollinators are not cryptic, corolla colors can be more or less conspicuous with the background and pollinators that are more efficient at detecting a particular morph will minimize their search time.

Once they reach their prey, they touch it very softly with their antennae to assess its size and nutritional value. After each poke, the antenna is hastily retracted to avoid detection by the prey individual. This investigation may last anywhere upwards of ten seconds, until the velvet worm makes a decision as to whether to attack it, or until it disturbs the prey and the prey flees. Hungry Onychophora spend less time investigating their prey and are quicker to apply their slime. Once slime has been squirted, Onychophora are determined to pursue and devour their prey, in order to recoup the energetic investment. They have been observed to spend up to ten minutes searching for removed prey, after which they return to their slime to eat it. In the case of smaller prey, they may opt not to use slime at all. Subsequently, a soft part of the prey item (usually a joint membrane in arthropod prey) is identified, punctured with a bite from the jaws, and injected with saliva. This kills the prey very quickly and begins a slower process of digestion. While the onychophoran waits for the prey to digest, it salivates on its slime and begins to eat it (and anything attached to it). It subsequently tugs and slices at the earlier perforation to allow access to the now-liquefied interior of its prey.  The jaws operate by moving backwards and forwards along the axis of the body (not in a side-to-side clipping motion as in arthropods), conceivably using a pairing of musculature and hydrostatic pressure. The pharynx is specially adapted for sucking, to extract the liquefied tissue; the arrangement of the jaws about the tongue and lip papillae ensures a tight seal and the establishment of suction. In social groups, the dominant female is the first to feed, not permitting competitors access to the prey item for the first hour of feeding. Subsequently, subordinate individuals begin to feed. The number of males reaches a peak after females start to leave the prey item. After feeding, individuals clean their antennae and mouth parts before re-joining the rest of their group.",How do predators and prey influence biodiversity?,train,"[[0.9579798579216003, 0.04202019050717354], [0.9027959108352661, 0.09720408916473389], [0.9782136082649231, 0.021786414086818695], [0.9640594124794006, 0.035940587520599365], [0.9650804996490479, 0.03491949662566185], [0.9693305492401123, 0.030669456347823143], [0.97267085313797, 0.027329176664352417], [0.9273617267608643, 0.07263834774494171], [0.9653584957122803, 0.03464151546359062], [0.9733063578605652, 0.02669365517795086], [0.9857752323150635, 0.014224833808839321], [0.9554010033607483, 0.04459897801280022], [0.9826576113700867, 0.01734241470694542], [0.9758145213127136, 0.02418546937406063], [0.9524911046028137, 0.04750887677073479], [0.931545078754425, 0.06845495104789734], [0.9668604731559753, 0.033139485865831375], [0.9874380230903625, 0.012561919167637825]]","[[1.6931178569793701, -1.4335588216781616], [1.2364808320999146, -0.992202877998352], [2.0265390872955322, -1.777902364730835], [1.7814024686813354, -1.5078833103179932], [1.7969659566879272, -1.5222002267837524], [1.8582838773727417, -1.5950545072555542], [1.925153136253357, -1.6469377279281616], [1.398226261138916, -1.148624300956726], [1.791810393333435, -1.535636305809021], [1.9333287477493286, -1.6629441976547241], [2.239851236343384, -1.998587727546692], [1.6688097715377808, -1.3956104516983032], [2.134211540222168, -1.9028942584991455], [1.965559720993042, -1.7319607734680176], [1.6236835718154907, -1.3744806051254272], [1.4150878190994263, -1.1955807209014893], [1.8172073364257812, -1.5561213493347168], [2.3024182319641113, -2.062025785446167]]",0.09720408916473389,0.0381033254476885

Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit.  Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell. In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example, eat millions of microscopic plankton at once, the prey being broken down well after entering the whale. Seed predation and egg predation are other forms of true predation, as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms. Predators of this classification need not eat prey entirely. For example, some predators cannot digest bones, while others can. Some may eat only part of an organism, as in grazing (see below), but still consistently cause its direct death.",How do predators and prey influence biodiversity?,train,"[[0.9448347091674805, 0.055165328085422516], [0.9040510058403015, 0.09594898670911789], [0.8551715016365051, 0.14482851326465607], [0.9485086798667908, 0.05149126052856445], [0.9606415033340454, 0.039358437061309814], [0.9432958364486694, 0.056704163551330566], [0.9434064626693726, 0.05659353733062744], [0.9523879289627075, 0.0476120263338089], [0.9696769118309021, 0.030323145911097527], [0.9051738381385803, 0.09482616931200027], [0.8633001446723938, 0.13669990003108978], [0.8536450862884521, 0.14635494351387024], [0.9540417790412903, 0.0459582656621933]]","[[1.5522454977035522, -1.2884297370910645], [1.2525159120559692, -0.9905532002449036], [1.0207178592681885, -0.7550337314605713], [1.579843521118164, -1.3336353302001953], [1.7337056398391724, -1.461185336112976], [1.5279170274734497, -1.283615231513977], [1.5315226316452026, -1.282079815864563], [1.6240004301071167, -1.3718866109848022], [1.867845058441162, -1.597206711769104], [1.2643808126449585, -0.9917008876800537], [1.060286045074463, -0.7826884388923645], [1.0262995958328247, -0.7371810674667358], [1.6478575468063354, -1.3851162195205688]]",0.14635494351387024,0.07706651363808376

This arrangement led to inefficiencies due to the inherent conflicts of interest that the four partner companies faced; they were both GIE shareholders of, and subcontractors to, the consortium. The companies collaborated on development of the Airbus range, but guarded the financial details of their own production activities and sought to maximise the transfer prices of their sub-assemblies. It was becoming clear that Airbus was no longer a temporary collaboration to produce a single plane as per its original mission statement, it had become a long term brand for the development of further aircraft. By the late 1980s work had begun on a pair of new medium-sized aircraft, the biggest to be produced at this point under the Airbus name, the Airbus A330 and the Airbus A340.In the early 1990s the then Airbus CEO Jean Pierson argued that the GIE should be abandoned and Airbus established as a conventional company. However, the difficulties of integrating and valuing the assets of four companies, as well as legal issues, delayed the initiative. In December 1998, when it was reported that British Aerospace and DASA were close to merging, Aérospatiale paralysed negotiations on the Airbus conversion; the French company feared the combined BAe/DASA, which would own 57.9% of Airbus, would dominate the company and it insisted on a 50/50 split. However, the issue was resolved in January 1999 when BAe abandoned talks with DASA in favour of merging with Marconi Electronic Systems to become BAE Systems. Then in 2000 three of the four partner companies (DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, successor to Deutsche Airbus; Aérospatiale-Matra, successor to Sud-Aviation; and CASA) merged to form EADS, simplifying the process. EADS now owned Airbus France, Airbus Deutschland and Airbus España, and thus 80% of Airbus Industrie.

(1972) said “K is a scientific discipline that studies the body size, the proportionality, the performance of movement, the body composition and principal functions of the body. This so well cited definition is not completely exact as the last four words show. What are the kinanthropometric methods that truly tell us something about principal functions of the body? In principle an amount or distribution of fat mass or muscular mass could be correlated or show a level of causation with any disease. The morpho-physiological mechanisms involved in those explanations are big enigmas today. Few diseases are in practice diagnosed using anthropometric measures and body composition methods at any public health care system. The use of body composition outcomes for predicting health status due to their associations with a lot of physiological variables is valid. However, this purpose is not included within the kinanthropometric perspective because the absent of movement prediction's probability in those diagnoses. The countless uses of some of its fundamental methods have to be accepted but they should not change the theoretical core of the scientific discipline. On the other hand, this definition omits some important objectives of quantifying the body that are an indelible part of its frame; for example: the study of human shape using the  method of the anthropometric somatotype of Carter and Heath (1990). Besides that, the performance of movement is why one studies the body size, proportionality, body composition, and human shape. It is confusing to write at the same level the performance of movement because then one never clearly portrays the purpose of the discipline, meaning that a descriptive knowledge of the body is the sole purpose while you are mixing the real scope in the statement.",What is the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?,train,"[[0.9595217108726501, 0.04047827795147896], [0.9877158999443054, 0.012284113094210625], [0.9744885563850403, 0.02551143430173397], [0.9702535271644592, 0.02974645048379898], [0.9755418300628662, 0.02445816993713379], [0.9735022783279419, 0.026497723534703255], [0.988132655620575, 0.011867285706102848], [0.9846528172492981, 0.0153471939265728], [0.964876115322113, 0.035123903304338455], [0.9022731781005859, 0.09772683680057526], [0.9342103004455566, 0.06578966975212097], [0.9047595858573914, 0.09524035453796387], [0.9533315896987915, 0.046668343245983124], [0.9010294079780579, 0.09897061437368393]]","[[1.7156203985214233, -1.4500489234924316], [2.3218464851379395, -2.065241813659668], [1.9561796188354492, -1.6866062879562378], [1.8906193971633911, -1.5942281484603882], [1.9801379442214966, -1.7058907747268677], [1.9415522813796997, -1.6622891426086426], [2.3379788398742676, -2.084052324295044], [2.218493938446045, -1.942862629890442], [1.7997146844863892, -1.513403058052063], [1.247876524925232, -0.9748644828796387], [1.475906252861023, -1.1773325204849243], [1.2655999660491943, -0.9856655597686768], [1.6484061479568481, -1.3684905767440796], [1.2460405826568604, -0.9626742601394653]]",0.09897061437368393,0.04469359792502863

Such information could potentially be sold to others for profit and/or be used for purposes not known to or sanctioned by the individual concerned. The concept of information privacy has become more significant as more systems controlling more information appear. Also the consequences of privacy violations can be more severe.

ROTATOR CUFF INJURY AND TREATMENT OPTIONS The rotator cuff can tear as an acute injury such as when lifting a heavy weight or falling on the shoulder or elbow. The shoulder is immediately weak and there is pain when trying to lift the arm. A torn rotator cuff due to an injury is usually best treated by immediate surgical repair. The rotator cuff can also wear out as a result of degenerative changes. This type of rotator cuff tear can usually be repaired but sometimes the tear",Tell me more about some shoulder exercises that could help recovery from an injury.,train,"[[0.8952271938323975, 0.10477283596992493], [0.9063071608543396, 0.0936928391456604], [0.9558586478233337, 0.04414135590195656], [0.9329901933670044, 0.06700977683067322], [0.9566515684127808, 0.04334842413663864], [0.9474409222602844, 0.052559033036231995], [0.9423733353614807, 0.05762670189142227], [0.962949812412262, 0.0370502769947052], [0.9717257618904114, 0.0282742939889431], [0.9411466717720032, 0.058853283524513245], [0.3184584379196167, 0.6815415024757385], [0.8473443388938904, 0.1526557207107544], [0.8225368857383728, 0.17746306955814362], [0.9445763826370239, 0.05542368069291115], [0.9588271379470825, 0.0411728173494339], [0.9331532120704651, 0.06684675812721252]]","[[1.2096329927444458, -0.9356499910354614], [1.2650192975997925, -1.004337191581726], [1.6688475608825684, -1.4063653945922852], [1.4449576139450073, -1.1885985136032104], [1.6835230588912964, -1.410645842552185], [1.5812777280807495, -1.3105498552322388], [1.5242193937301636, -1.2701960802078247], [1.7640284299850464, -1.4936970472335815], [1.8926697969436646, -1.6444507837295532], [1.517236351966858, -1.2548151016235352], [-0.1910741627216339, 0.5697910189628601], [1.0106343030929565, -0.7032877206802368], [0.9329721927642822, -0.6006587147712708], [1.55441153049469, -1.2813180685043335], [1.710707426071167, -1.4372249841690063], [1.4531346559524536, -1.1830319166183472]]",0.6815415024757385,0.11015202314592898

Interventional tables with floating table tops and tilt and cradle compete with fully integrated flexible OR tables. Identification of the right table is a compromise between interventional and surgical requirements. Surgical and interventional requirements may be mutually exclusive. Surgeons, especially orthopedic, general and neurosurgeons usually expect a table with a segmented tabletop for flexible patient positioning. For imaging purposes, a radiolucent tabletop, allowing full body coverage, is required. Therefore, non-breakable carbon fibre tabletops are used. Interventionalists require a floating tabletop to allow fast and precise movements during angiography. Cardiac and vascular surgeons, in general, have less complex positioning needs, but based on their interventional experience in angiography may be used to having fully motorized movements of the table and the tabletop. For positioning patients on non breakable tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. inflatable cushions. Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable angiography tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended. To further accommodate typical surgical needs, side rails for mounting surgical equipment like retractors or limb holders should be available for the table. The position of the table in the room also impacts surgical workflow. A diagonal position in the OR may be considered in order to gain space and flexibility in the room, as well as access to the patient from all sides. Alternatively, a conventional surgery table can be combined with an imaging system if the vendor offers a corresponding integration. The operating room can then be used either with a radiotranslucent but not breakable tabletop that supports 3D imaging, or with a universal breakable tabletop that provides enhanced patient positioning, but restricts 3D imaging. The latter are particularly suited for neuro- or orthopedic surgery, and these integrated solutions recently also became commercially available. If it is planned to share the room for hybrid and open conventional procedures, these are sometimes preferred. They provide greater workflow flexibility because the tabletops are dockable and can be easily exchanged, but require some compromises with interventional imaging. In summary, important aspects to be included considered are the position in the room, radiolucency (carbon fiber tabletop), compatibility, and integration of imaging devices with the operating table.

In some cases with juveniles, bracing has reduced curves significantly, going from a 40 degrees (of the curve, mentioned in length above.) out of the brace to 18 degrees in it. Braces are sometimes prescribed for adults to relieve pain related to scoliosis. Bracing involves fitting the patient with a device that covers the torso; in some cases, it extends to the neck. The most commonly used brace is a TLSO, such as a Boston brace, a corset-like appliance that fits from armpits to hips and is custom-made from fiberglass or plastic. It is sometimes worn 22–23 hours a day, depending on the doctor's prescription, and applies pressure on the curves in the spine. The effectiveness of the brace depends not only on brace design and orthotist skill but on patient compliance and amount of wear per day.The typical use of braces is for idiopathic curves that are not grave enough to warrant surgery, but they may also be used to prevent the progression of more severe curves in young children, to buy the child time to grow before performing surgery, which would prevent further growth in the part of the spine affected.",When should you consider shoulder surgery?,train,"[[0.8342651128768921, 0.1657348871231079], [0.9409986734390259, 0.05900128558278084], [0.9593968391418457, 0.040603168308734894], [0.9414801597595215, 0.0585198700428009], [0.9674451947212219, 0.03255481272935867], [0.888213574886322, 0.11178642511367798], [0.8947176933288574, 0.10528236627578735], [0.9013691544532776, 0.09863092005252838]]","[[0.9588700532913208, -0.6572917103767395], [1.5133099555969238, -1.2560726404190063], [1.7205175161361694, -1.4419411420822144], [1.5116045475006104, -1.2664823532104492], [1.831421971321106, -1.5603117942810059], [1.1511644124984741, -0.9214576482772827], [1.189610481262207, -0.9502517580986023], [1.2269062995910645, -0.9856237173080444]]",0.1657348871231079,0.08401421690359712

The Buck Double was a quarter-pound double cheese burger designed to compete against the McDonald's McDouble sandwich. The primary issue was financial in nature, the franchises claimed that Burger King forced them to sell the sandwich at a loss of 10¢ per sandwich.  Franchisees sued the parent company claiming that it did not have the authority to dictate pricing structures for the independently held franchises. The court dismissed the case in a decision that stated the company could legally dictate pricing structures over its franchises objections, but found that there was enough evidence to allow the franchises to move forward with their claims of dealing in bad faith in a separate case. In response to the decision, the franchise group filed a second suit that claimed the deal was not properly structured and was implemented without the franchises' consent.

Smith to help revamp the company. Smith initiated a restructuring of all future franchising agreements. New owners were barred from living more than an hour's drive from their restaurants, corporations were not permitted to own franchises, and franchisees could no longer operate other chains. This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King as Chart House had. It also became a requirement for the corporation to own the properties of any new store and lease them to franchisees. This policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies. Beyond the changes to the franchise system, Smith also restructured Burger King's corporate operations to better compete against his former employer as well as then up and coming chain Wendy's. He broadened the product offering by adding the Burger King specialty sandwich line in 1979, and also added many non-hamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings. The new line was one of the first attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic, in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years, members of which were presumably willing spend more on a higher quality product. The new products were successful and the company's sales increased by 15%.",How much does a Burger King franchise owner typically make?,train,"[[0.9583443999290466, 0.04165562242269516], [0.9745645523071289, 0.025435499846935272], [0.6564011573791504, 0.3435988426208496], [0.9723495244979858, 0.02765052765607834], [0.8777758479118347, 0.1222241073846817], [0.9432154297828674, 0.05678454786539078], [0.9525613784790039, 0.04743867367506027], [0.9425496459007263, 0.0574503056704998], [0.8038462400436401, 0.19615377485752106], [0.8623279929161072, 0.13767197728157043]]","[[1.735140085220337, -1.4006305932998657], [1.9831314086914062, -1.6627134084701538], [0.5050876140594482, -0.14220969378948212], [1.9328309297561646, -1.62723970413208], [1.1326184272766113, -0.838916540145874], [1.560712456703186, -1.24931800365448], [1.658834457397461, -1.340882420539856], [1.5495184659957886, -1.2481497526168823], [0.8676785826683044, -0.5428305864334106], [1.0775514841079712, -0.757210373878479]]",0.3435988426208496,0.10560638792812824

The main cause of this gradual globalization was the successes of the large restaurant chains. Their desires to expand their businesses and increase their profits resulted in them creating franchises around the world. McDonald's was among the very first of the burger chains to take the global establishment of its brand seriously, but it was not the only one. Wimpy began operating in the United Kingdom in 1954, 20 years before McDonald's began operation in the country, and by 1970 it had expanded to over a thousand restaurants in 23 countries. On August 21, 1971, in Zaandam, near Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Ahold opened its first European franchise. In the 1970s, McDonald's began to expand into Europe and Australia. In Asia, Japan saw the establishment of its own fast food chain in 1972: , an abbreviation of 'Mountain, Ocean, Sun', which eventually became a direct competitor to McDonald's. All of its products, however, were variations on the burger adapted to the Asian world, including the teriyaki burger, takumi burger, and riceburger. In Hong Kong, Aji Ichiban competed with large chains before it spread quickly throughout Asia.

Smith to help revamp the company. Smith initiated a restructuring of all future franchising agreements, disallowing new owners from living more than an hour's drive from their restaurants, preventing corporations from owning franchises and prohibiting franchisees from operating other chains. This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King as Chart House had. Smith also altered the way the company dealt with new properties by making the company the primary owner of new locations and rent or lease the restaurants to its franchises. This policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies. However, by 1988 Burger King parent Pillsbury had relaxed many of Smith's changes, scaled back on construction of new locations and stalling growth. When Pillsbury was acquired in 1989 by Grand Metropolitan, the company fell further into decline, a pattern which continued under Grand Met successor Diageo. This institutionalized neglect further hurt the standing of the brand, in turn causing significant financial damage to Burger King's franchises.",Is it better to be a Burger King franchisee or an independent restaurant owner?,train,"[[0.8236033916473389, 0.17639662325382233], [0.6468775868415833, 0.3531223237514496], [0.7477578520774841, 0.2522420883178711], [0.6690984964370728, 0.330901563167572], [0.5335078239440918, 0.4664922058582306], [0.7878811359405518, 0.21211887896060944], [0.8571770191192627, 0.1428229808807373], [0.8047690987586975, 0.1952308863401413]]","[[0.9450210928916931, -0.5959329605102539], [0.42951327562332153, -0.17582929134368896], [0.7420315742492676, -0.34465840458869934], [0.5188947916030884, -0.1852155327796936], [0.1820567101240158, 0.04782429337501526], [0.8309429287910461, -0.48125746846199036], [1.0387496948242188, -0.7532888650894165], [0.8702214360237122, -0.5461511611938477]]",0.4664922058582306,0.2661659438163042

An example of a protein that displays different function in different oligomeric states is pyruvate kinase which exhibits metabolic activity as a tetramer and thyroid hormone–binding activity as a monomer. Changes in the concentrations of ligands or substrates may cause a switch in protein a protein's function.  For example, in the presence of low iron concentrations, aconitase functions as an enzyme while at high iron concentration, aconitase functions as an iron-responsive element-binding protein (IREBP). Proteins may also perform separate functions through the use of alternative binding sites that perform different tasks. An example of this is ceruloplasmin, a protein that functions as an oxidase in copper metabolism and moonlights as a copper-independent glutathione peroxidase. Lastly, phosphorylation may sometimes cause a switch in the function of a moonlighting protein. For example, phosphorylation of phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) at Ser-185 by protein kinase CK2 causes it to stop functioning as an enzyme, while retaining its function as an autocrine motility factor. Hence when a mutation takes place that inactivates a function of a moonlighting proteins, the other function(s) are not necessarily affected.",What's an alternative to the strap-in binding style for snowboarding?,train,"[[0.9019137024879456, 0.09808635711669922], [0.910306990146637, 0.08969303965568542], [0.9489671587944031, 0.051032811403274536], [0.8745560050010681, 0.1254439800977707], [0.8927791118621826, 0.10722092539072037], [0.8693072199821472, 0.13069278001785278], [0.9031877517700195, 0.09681222587823868], [0.8834954500198364, 0.11650459468364716], [0.8974347710609436, 0.10256528854370117]]","[[1.2349096536636353, -0.9837609529495239], [1.2901147603988647, -1.0272740125656128], [1.5916560888290405, -1.3312493562698364], [1.0874546766281128, -0.8544023633003235], [1.1896148920059204, -0.9298326969146729], [1.0822691917419434, -0.8125780820846558], [1.2363982200622559, -0.9967589378356934], [1.1322523355484009, -0.8937031626701355], [1.220999836921692, -0.9480410814285278]]",0.13069278001785278,0.10200577808751

He has been featured in nearly 300 pages of industry coverage since turning pro. Montoya was named 'Rock Star of the Year' in the 2004 Transworld Magazine Rider's Poll and was ranked third on Snowboard Magazine's list of the top 10 Riders of 2005.

He is a primary stakeholder in many successful snowboard industry companies from technology to hospitality. In addition, he opened his own chain of snowboarding related hotels, called The Block, which closed in 2009 due to tax issues.

The land spreading area is determined on the basis of a calculated loading rate that considers the absolute salt concentration, hydrocarbon concentration, metals concentration, and pH level after mixing with the soil. The drilling waste is spread on the land and incorporated into the upper soil zone (typically upper 6–8 inches of soil) to enhance hydrocarbon volatization and biodegradation.

Once they suspect a chemical may be toxic, it is studied to determine the human reference dose, which is determined to be the lowest observable adverse effect level. During these studies, a high dose is tested to see if it causes any adverse health effects, and if it does not, lower doses are considered to be safe as well. This does not take into account the fact that with some chemicals found in plastics, such as BPA, lower doses can have a discernible effect.Even with this often complicated evaluation process, policies have been put into place in order to help alleviate plastic pollution and its effects. Government regulations have been implemented that ban some chemicals from being used in specific plastic products. In Canada, the United States, and the European Union, BPA has been banned from being incorporated in the production of baby bottles and children’s cups, due to health concerns and the higher vulnerability of younger children to the effects of BPA. Taxes have been established in order to discourage specific ways of managing plastic waste. The landfill tax, for example, creates an incentive to choose to recycle plastics rather than contain them in landfills, by making the latter more expensive. There has also been a standardization of the types of plastics that can be considered compostable.

Plastics pose a particular challenge in recycling because they are derived from polymers and monomers that often cannot be separated and returned to their virgin states, for this reason not all plastics can be recycled for re-use, in fact some estimates claim only 20% to 30% of plastics can be recycled at all. Fibre-reinforced plastics and their matrices share these disposal and environmental concerns. In addition to these concerns, the fact that the fibres themselves are difficult to remove from the matrix and preserve for re-use means FRP's amplify these challenges. FRP's are inherently difficult to separate into base materials, that is into fibre and matrix, and the matrix into separate usable plastics, polymers, and monomers. These are all concerns for environmentally informed design today. Plastics do often offer savings in energy and economic savings in comparison to other materials. In addition, with the advent of new more environmentally friendly matrices such as bioplastics and UV-degradable plastics, FRP will gain environmental sensitivity.",How are biodegradable plastics made?,train,"[[0.8304492831230164, 0.16955071687698364], [0.4729573130607605, 0.5270426869392395], [0.6730782389640808, 0.3269217014312744], [0.5620191097259521, 0.4379809498786926], [0.4171675145626068, 0.5828324556350708], [0.8532812595367432, 0.14671872556209564], [0.4633508622646332, 0.5366491079330444], [0.46214359998703003, 0.5378564596176147]]","[[0.9517360925674438, -0.6370786428451538], [0.053003642708063126, 0.16128003597259521], [0.4985576570034027, -0.22358323633670807], [0.22722458839416504, -0.022135870531201363], [-0.062200020998716354, 0.2722119092941284], [1.0503636598587036, -0.7102083563804626], [0.030603909865021706, 0.1774638295173645], [0.00946891587227583, 0.16118493676185608]]",0.5828324556350708,0.408194100484252

Recovering germ as intact as possible is necessary to prevent any oil contamination in the final products. Attrition mills like Disk mill is used to coarse grind the softened corn kernels. The grinding is slow and the elements used to grind are blunt to ensure intact removal of germ. Water is added to the ground material to make a thick slurry of macerated kernels and whole germ. 40-50% of crude oil in germ makes it less dense than other particles and as a result germ floats in the mixture. The mixture is then passed through germ hydrocyclones with an over and underflow. Overflow will be composed majorly of germ and water and underflow will have fiber, starch, protein and water. The overflow is passed through the hydroclone multiple times since 100% separation cannot be achieved in single pass. The separated germ is cleaned, dried and passed through germ press to extract oil from it. Solvent extraction can also be used alternatively. The solid particles remaining after oil extraction is called germ meal which is further dried.Use of germ meal: It is a good source of amino acids and is carrier of micro-ingredients in animal food formulations.

He mentions only the Cheyenne delegation as if they came alone.  However, James Mooney, an ethnologist tasked by the US government with investigating the Ghost Dance and who travelled far and wide to interview all the principals in the tribes concerned, including Wovoka himself, tells a different story.  Porcupine's delegation was part of a larger, organised mission, perhaps a dozen people, sent out by a conference of chiefs at Fort Washakie in Wyoming with the explicit purpose of obtaining information about the new religion.  The mission included delegates from the Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapahoe, and Shoshoni.  It seems likely that the Arapahoe visit was a cover story to make easier obtaining permission from the Indian agent to leave the reservation.  US soldiers guarding the reservation were under orders to stop anyone from leaving without a permit.  Porcupine, however, travelled without a permit until he reached Fort Hall Indian Reservation in Idaho where he was given one by the Indian agent there.  At Fort Hall, more Shoshoni and Bannock Indians joined them.  The Indian agent at Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation in Nevada reported that the strength of the party was thirty-four as they passed through.  Porcupine says that all the Indians they met after Fort Hall were already performing the Ghost Dance, and that many whites (these would be mostly Mormons in Nevada) were also dancing.",Tell me what other fun things there are to do in Tokyo besides eating.,train,"[[0.9348072409629822, 0.06519272178411484], [0.9760277271270752, 0.023972297087311745], [0.9643059968948364, 0.0356939397752285], [0.9872499108314514, 0.012750065885484219], [0.972488284111023, 0.02751171588897705], [0.9713277816772461, 0.028672197833657265], [0.9692538380622864, 0.03074619174003601], [0.9847458600997925, 0.015254136174917221], [0.9574099779129028, 0.042589977383613586], [0.9875074028968811, 0.012492557056248188], [0.9787458181381226, 0.021254176273941994]]","[[1.4732582569122314, -1.1897341012954712], [2.0013577938079834, -1.705234408378601], [1.8072806596755981, -1.4891469478607178], [2.3087611198425293, -2.04062557220459], [1.9385716915130615, -1.6266745328903198], [1.9120384454727173, -1.610697627067566], [1.8838472366333008, -1.5669132471084595], [2.221853256225586, -1.945679783821106], [1.7063047885894775, -1.4063078165054321], [2.3280086517333984, -2.0420422554016113], [2.065279960632324, -1.7644386291503906]]",0.06519272178411484,0.028739088807593693

Option A would see the additional capacity supplied by temporary stands erected behind each goal, removing the current roof, and be supported by steel structures, with all the stands removed after the World Cup and the original roofing replaced. Option B would also see temporary seating built in the north and south stands as well as an additional structure placed on the east stand which the club could choose to keep, increasing the capacity to 39,000. The final Option, C, would see the removal of seating from the north, south and east stands and three new 20 row decks placed in each stand.

Bell was voted the AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.  The Steelers defeated their division rival, the Baltimore Ravens, 27-10 in the AFC Divisional round at Heinz Field.

So Tommy Maddox was named starter for their home game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Steelers struggled throughout the game, as Maddox threw two interceptions through regulation, but they managed to tie at 17 going into OT. Maddox threw an interception to Jags DB Rashean Mathis, who returned it 41 yards for a touchdown, as the Steelers fell, 23–17. Maddox's off-field arguments with head coach Bill Cowher cost him his No. 1 back-up spot. Roethlisberger was able to play in their next road game against their division rival, the Cincinnati Bengals.

Batch broke his hand, which sent him to the sidelines. Tommy Maddox was given the start for their road game against the Ravens, but again, he showed his inefficiency, as the Steelers fell in overtime 16–13.

In Week 15, the Ravens would beat the Detroit Lions at Ford Field 18-16 off Justin Tucker's 6 field goals, including a 61-yarder that proved to be the game-clinching score followed by a Matthew Stafford interception. In Week 16 the Ravens would lose at home to the New England Patriots 41-7 making it the second worst home loss in Ravens history. In Week 17 the Ravens faced the Cincinnati Bengals.

Baltimore tied the game 17-17 in the second half, but surrendered 17 unanswered points to the Bengals, thus ending their season at 8-8 and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2007.",Tell me more about Steelers' defense scheme.,validation,"[[0.9802290201187134, 0.01977091282606125], [0.7534409165382385, 0.2465590089559555], [0.9706231951713562, 0.02937682718038559], [0.9818288087844849, 0.018171170726418495], [0.8790316581726074, 0.12096832692623138], [0.9805763363838196, 0.019423671066761017], [0.9612008333206177, 0.03879917785525322], [0.9785856008529663, 0.021414345130324364], [0.9366078972816467, 0.06339210271835327], [0.9673155546188354, 0.03268439322710037], [0.9592467546463013, 0.04075327143073082], [0.9782119989395142, 0.021788012236356735], [0.9858848452568054, 0.014115125872194767], [0.8937926888465881, 0.10620735585689545], [0.9414328336715698, 0.058567218482494354], [0.9718851447105408, 0.028114892542362213], [0.9224309325218201, 0.07756909728050232], [0.9796302318572998, 0.02036973275244236], [0.9646983742713928, 0.03530160337686539], [0.9804506301879883, 0.01954943686723709], [0.9720115065574646, 0.027988502755761147], [0.9867357015609741, 0.013264348730444908], [0.9600492715835571, 0.039950717240571976], [0.9539138674736023, 0.04608617722988129], [0.9745397567749023, 0.02546028606593609], [0.9321209192276001, 0.06787911057472229], [0.9885905385017395, 0.011409439146518707], [0.9722349047660828, 0.02776511386036873], [0.9833842515945435, 0.01661571115255356], [0.9843528866767883, 0.015647122636437416], [0.8174585103988647, 0.18254151940345764], [0.9806862473487854, 0.019313758239150047]]","[[2.101541042327881, -1.8020333051681519], [0.7725435495376587, -0.34450563788414], [1.897202491760254, -1.6005295515060425], [2.1405842304229736, -1.8489962816238403], [1.1354652643203735, -0.8478268384933472], [2.10825777053833, -1.8133902549743652], [1.7488478422164917, -1.460936427116394], [2.054229497909546, -1.7678178548812866], [1.485031008720398, -1.2078944444656372], [1.8482086658477783, -1.5394184589385986], [1.7247990369796753, -1.4338133335113525], [2.0561153888702393, -1.7482513189315796], [2.262484550476074, -1.983807921409607], [1.2095001935958862, -0.9205803275108337], [1.5363291501998901, -1.240898609161377], [1.9180914163589478, -1.6248466968536377], [1.3800179958343506, -1.0958255529403687], [2.0844335556030273, -1.788691520690918], [1.8000928163528442, -1.5077942609786987], [2.1034317016601562, -1.8116341829299927], [1.920701265335083, -1.6268725395202637], [2.2894387245178223, -2.019883394241333], [1.7401173114776611, -1.4392205476760864], [1.656475305557251, -1.3735848665237427], [1.968152403831482, -1.676693081855774], [1.441144585609436, -1.1785895824432373], [2.3696038722991943, -2.0922353267669678], [1.9273035526275635, -1.6285134553909302], [2.1912660598754883, -1.8893853425979614], [2.21867299079895, -1.9230244159698486], [0.9545658826828003, -0.5446566343307495], [2.1091909408569336, -1.8182439804077148]]",0.2465590089559555,0.047713046573335305

In a water tube boiler, the water is recirculated inside until the vapor pressure of the water overcomes the vapor pressure inside the stream drum and becomes saturated steam. The forced circulation boiler begins the same as a natural circulation boiler, at the feed water pump. Water is introduced into the steam drum and is circulated around the boiler, leaving only as steam.  What makes the forced circulation boiler different is its use of a secondary pump that circulates water through the boiler. The secondary pump takes the feed water going to the boiler and raises the pressure of the water going in.  In a natural circulation boilers, the circulation of water is dependent on the differential pressures caused by the change of density in the water as it is heated. That is to say that as the water is heated and starts turning to steam, the density decreases sending the hottest water and steam to the top of the furnace tubes. In contrast to the natural circulation boiler, the forced circulation boiler uses a water circulation pump to force that flow instead of waiting for the differential to form. Because of this, the generation tubes of a forced circulation boiler are able to be oriented in whatever way is required by space constraints. Water is taken from the drum and forced through the steel tubes. In this way it is able to produce steam much faster than that of a natural circulation boiler",Oh that much water?

Activism can take many forms, one of the most common and achievable being the power of boycotting products that support the exploitation and abuse of women and/or animals. For example, vegetarian ecofeminists might boycott products that were created in sweatshops and therefore exploited women, or products that were tested on animals or that were created by killing animals and therefore exploited nonhuman animals. The act of being a vegetarian or a vegan is itself a form of boycotting, for it choosing not to consume products that were created at the expense of killing or abusing nonhuman animals. Even at the Ecofeminist Task Force of the National Women's Studies Association suggested that no animal products should be served the 1990 NWSA meeting or at future conferences due to ecological and humane issues. Vegetarian ecofeminist might put their beliefs into practice by participating in demonstrations, as was seen at the 1990 March for the Animals in Washington, D.C., when ecofeminists carried a banner showing their support of recognizing how the domination of humans over nonhumans animals fits into ecofeminism, but also feminism in general.",What are the benefits of being vegetarian to the environment?,train,"[[0.8166013360023499, 0.18339866399765015], [0.9531107544898987, 0.0468892827630043], [0.9559615850448608, 0.04403839632868767], [0.9248921275138855, 0.07510790973901749], [0.8815098404884338, 0.11849019676446915], [0.9009934663772583, 0.0990065485239029]]","[[0.8981043100357056, -0.5953845381736755], [1.6432191133499146, -1.368722677230835], [1.6720834970474243, -1.4055724143981934], [1.3804832696914673, -1.1302679777145386], [1.1278636455535889, -0.8789421916007996], [1.2305076122283936, -0.9778044819831848]]",0.18339866399765015,0.09448849968612194

Notably the only consistent members of Marc and the Mambas were Marc Almond, Anne Hogan and Steve James Sherlock. Almond and Sherlock, together with Annie Hogan recorded as Marc and the Mambas.His inventive playing featured prominently on ‘Torment and Toreros‘. Sherlock notably sharing writing credits with Almond for the track Narcissus for the album. Marc and the Mambas could be considered the blueprint for Marc Almond's solo career. Torment and Toreros being an eclectic blend of Vaudeville, French chanson, goth sensibility, guitar noise, saxophones/flutes, piano and string sections. Marc Almond became mentally ill during the course of making the album and he later noted ironically that the Torment and Toreros album was a nervous breakdown put to music.'Torment and Toreros' reached #28 in the UK album charts in August 1983. Shortly after completing the album Almond disbanded the band. Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons has referred to Marc and the Mambas being  his favorite band all through his teens, becoming the starting point for Antony and the Johnsons and the album 'Torment and Toreros' being probably the definitive record of his adolescence.2012 - Steve James Sherlock featured on Marc and the Mambas limited edition CD/DVD set Three Black Nights of Little Black Bites - Live at the Duke of York's Theatre, 1983.

Although traditional cost accounting recognizes loss of materials, waste management costs are not separated but integrated in the total cost of production. This practice makes difficult to identify easily and clearly which part of production is due to losses or waste generation. MFCA highlights waste management costs and inefficiency of processes therefore making easier to identify room for improvements. Many losses produce environmental impact (air pollution, water pollution, health problems, etc) therefore identifying losses, the framework aims to make easier to also reduce some environmental impacts.

These studies show that there is not yet a consistent methodology for measuring energy consumption in local versus non-local farms. “Local” is not a clearly defined measurement, and by only examining the energy in terms of “food miles” versus an entire life cycle assessment (LCA), much of the research on local farming is missing key components of the farm-to-consumer process, and the energy consumption involved. For example, despite the amount of greenhouse gases emitted from transporting farm foods to consumers, agricultural soils are also responsible for releasing significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (Schlesinger).The life cycle assessment attempts to measure the impacts of each activity directly or indirectly involved in the production, transport, storage, retail, consumption and disposal of a particular food from “farm to fork” or “farm to waste”. Studies that examine the LCA still show that there is no clear conclusion on the environmental impact of local versus non-local agriculture. A study in Sweden that examined bread production using local flour versus flour from other regions in Sweden found that the smaller scale of local farms results in less energy efficiency5.  Another study supports this argument that global food systems have better energy efficiency due to the size of production, the so-called “ecology-of-scale”. Both of these studies are countered by other studies that found lower emissions on small scale bread making facilities, contesting the accuracy of the measurements in the Schilich and Fleissner study. These studies show the inherent variation in farming production, which leads to varying levels of impact on the environment.

If one were to hold his or her breath (or breathe very slowly, as in the case of respiratory depression), the blood would continue delivering carbon dioxide to the alveoli in the lungs, and the amount of carbon dioxide in the lungs would increase. On the other hand, if one were to hyperventilate, then fresh air would be drawn into the lungs and carbon dioxide would rapidly be blown out. In the first case, because carbon dioxide is accumulating in the lungs, alveolar P would become very high. In the second case, because carbon dioxide is rapidly exiting the lungs, alveolar P would be very low. Note that these two situations, those of respiratory depression and hyperventilation, produce effects that are immediately analogous to the experiment described previously, in which the partial pressures of carbon dioxide were varied and the resulting changes in pH observed. As indicated by the Davenport Diagram, respiratory depression, which results in a high P, will lower blood pH. Hyperventilation will have the opposite effects. A decrease in blood pH due to respiratory depression is called respiratory acidosis. An increase in blood pH due to hyperventilation is called respiratory alkalosis (Fig. 11).",What is high blood carbon dioxide?,train,"[[0.9813170433044434, 0.018683021888136864], [0.9715220332145691, 0.02847798354923725], [0.9939008951187134, 0.006099123042076826], [0.9456697702407837, 0.054330289363861084], [0.9918877482414246, 0.008112206123769283], [0.9882140159606934, 0.011785970069468021], [0.9398979544639587, 0.060102056711912155], [0.9951653480529785, 0.004834670107811689], [0.9913598895072937, 0.008640100248157978], [0.9843313694000244, 0.015668565407395363], [0.9856876730918884, 0.014312389306724072]]","[[2.121666669845581, -1.8396137952804565], [1.8983900547027588, -1.6313426494598389], [2.680349826812744, -2.413142442703247], [1.5435389280319214, -1.313272476196289], [2.52785587310791, -2.2783844470977783], [2.349757194519043, -2.0792322158813477], [1.4915032386779785, -1.2582240104675293], [2.7912325859069824, -2.5358636379241943], [2.5035295486450195, -2.239133596420288], [2.2047901153564453, -1.9355157613754272], [2.285579204559326, -1.9466346502304077]]",0.060102056711912155,0.0210042159835046

In 1961, this changed rapidly with the election of his collector Lyndon B. Johnson (1908–1973) to the Vice-Presidency of the United States. With his ascension from the United States Senate to being Vice President, Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson (1912–2007) purchased a large French-style chateau from the socialite and heiress Perle Mesta (1889–1975). They decorated the house with French antiques and tapestries that were already in the home, but the foyer was hung with Texas wildflower paintings by Salinas. Lady Bird Johnson was quoted as saying of them that 'I want to see them when I open the door, to remind me of where I come from.' After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson became President and his Salinas paintings were brought with him into the White House. He told the Washington press that Porfirio Salinas was 'his favorite artist.' President Johnson also presented a Salinas painting to President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz of Mexico as an official gift from the United States. The patronage of the President was a tremendous boost to the artist's career and during the 1960s, his work sold briskly for ever higher prices.

This quote from American anthropologist Wilhelm Solheim illustrates the matter:The finds at Ayub Cave in South Cotabato again verified the great pottery tradition of the Philippines. In terms of quantity and quality, these artifacts have no match in Southeast Asia for such an early time period. One interesting question is whether or not the Philippines ever developed an export industry for pottery. Generally it is known that the Thais had developed quite a flourishing industry, which is sometimes considered unique in SE Asia. However, it is well documented that the Philippines was in fact a major destination of pottery buyers from the islands of Japan at least. Japanese texts mention trading expeditions to the island of Rusun (Luzon) going well back before the Spanish period. What they sought were the highly prized Rusun and Namban jars. In fact, these jars were far more precious than gold to the Japanese because of their ability to act as tea canisters. Japanese texts were very specific about these jars being made in Luzon. The Tokiko, for example, calls the Rusun and Namban jars, Ru-sun tsukuru or Lu-sung ch'i (Chinese), which means simply 'made in Luzon.' In the Tokiko it mentions that all Rusun jars had this marking known as the rokuru (wheel mark). Those familiar with Philippine ethnography will know that this spiral is commonly used by many of the Philippine tribes. The following symbols were used to identify which kiln was used to make the jar: identified 'Imbe' jars, meant jars coming from Bizen kiln, and mark three times meant a canister from the same oven. A jar with this mark is said to be made of Namban clay. This marking corresponds to the syllable la in Pampanga; Tagbanua for ka ('Chinese Pottery,' Field Museum of Natural History-Anth., vol.xii, Jul.1912) Of course, the symbol for la can also be the same as that for lu, and so this might correspond to the symbol said to stand for Lu in Rusun-no kokuji (Luzon national writing). According to the Tokiko, certain types of Rusun jars were distinguished by this character. De Morga mentions that Japanese traders were still coming in large numbers for these jars during his time, and that they were willing to spend great sums for them. Apparently work on these jars continued in the North, possibly among the unconquered Igorots, for De Morga had no knowledge of such current production. Later, the knowledge may have again trickled down to Vigan, where a flourishing industry of Burnay jar manufacture survives to this day. Although the Japanese described very high quality jars coming from the Philippines, not all were of elegant nature. In fact, De Morga had some disdain for some of the jars that the Japanese were buying, so they could have been similar to the well-known balanga and other jars in use today. These jars are generally handed down as heirlooms and are noted for their qualities in enhancing the fermentation process. Possibly one of the Japanese uses for the Rusun jars was fermentation of products like Kombucha and Umeboshi plums. Indeed, a Japanese acquaintance stated that their family in rural Japan used old Rusun jars for exactly this purpose up to this day. The Filipinos were skilled in all types of fishing and fisheries. In the south, the basnig, a Viking-like ship, was and is the vessel of choice among the Bisayans for ocean fishing. The salambao is a type of raft that utilizes a large fishing net which is lowered into the water via a type of lever made of two criss-crossed poles. Night fishing was accomplished with the help of candles similar to the copal of Mexico. These candles were made from a particular type of resin. Fish corrals, like the ones still used today, were also employed by the ancient Filipino. However, the area in which the Filipino most astonished Westerners was in their advanced aquaculture:",Does the public pay Jared Kushner?,train,"[[0.9956403970718384, 0.004359632730484009], [0.9944451451301575, 0.005554893519729376], [0.9931528568267822, 0.006847145967185497], [0.9933023452758789, 0.00669765193015337], [0.9952585101127625, 0.004741455893963575], [0.9936284422874451, 0.0063715442083776], [0.9952136278152466, 0.004786334466189146], [0.9920709729194641, 0.007929009385406971], [0.9936736822128296, 0.006326334550976753], [0.9953784942626953, 0.004621520172804594], [0.9923827052116394, 0.0076172542758286], [0.9950428009033203, 0.004957143217325211], [0.9950078725814819, 0.004992108792066574], [0.9939427971839905, 0.0060572209767997265], [0.9948347806930542, 0.005165270529687405], [0.9888033270835876, 0.011196650564670563], [0.9941070079803467, 0.0058930013328790665], [0.9708452820777893, 0.029154689982533455], [0.9942417144775391, 0.005758346524089575], [0.9922282099723816, 0.00777174299582839], [0.9948239326477051, 0.0051760184578597546], [0.9912187457084656, 0.00878121703863144], [0.9949931502342224, 0.005006919614970684], [0.9950088262557983, 0.004991189576685429], [0.9942787885665894, 0.005721165798604488], [0.9954244494438171, 0.004575516562908888], [0.993980884552002, 0.0060191587544977665], [0.994508683681488, 0.005491352640092373], [0.9954662322998047, 0.004533698782324791], [0.9949538111686707, 0.00504617765545845], [0.9947245717048645, 0.005275437608361244], [0.9942517280578613, 0.005748352501541376]]","[[2.8197426795959473, -2.611255645751953], [2.7056527137756348, -2.4818527698516846], [2.6065030097961426, -2.3705499172210693], [2.6212053298950195, -2.37807297706604], [2.792313575744629, -2.554344654083252], [2.640676498413086, -2.4088447093963623], [2.7797694206237793, -2.5574233531951904], [2.5379791259765625, -2.291287660598755], [2.6445469856262207, -2.4121408462524414], [2.7916908264160156, -2.5807087421417236], [2.5511415004730225, -2.3185513019561768], [2.7541286945343018, -2.54782772064209], [2.7558422088623047, -2.5390498638153076], [2.671513319015503, -2.428915023803711], [2.7364516258239746, -2.524167776107788], [2.3598451614379883, -2.12103533744812], [2.6767451763153076, -2.451333999633789], [1.8920722007751465, -1.6134790182113647], [2.686342477798462, -2.464987277984619], [2.5540034770965576, -2.29545521736145], [2.7458767890930176, -2.512652635574341], [2.4883265495300293, -2.2379939556121826], [2.752563953399658, -2.539351224899292], [2.75734281539917, -2.5377347469329834], [2.690621852874756, -2.4672231674194336], [2.804370880126953, -2.5780787467956543], [2.677682876586914, -2.4290874004364014], [2.717148780822754, -2.4819254875183105], [2.8073949813842773, -2.584278106689453], [2.758162498474121, -2.525902509689331], [2.7342641353607178, -2.5051400661468506], [2.691187620162964, -2.4618895053863525]]",0.029154689982533455,0.006661411156528629

It was also played at the band's December 31, 1992 concert at The Academy Theater in New York City, where Vedder introduced the song as 'Brother'. Both of these performances of the song featured different lyrics than the version that would ultimately wind up on Vs. 'Daughter' is played at nearly every Pearl Jam show, almost always with an extension of the ending that could be an improvisation or a segment of another song. This extension is called a 'Daughter tag'. A different form of extension to the song was first introduced in the band's performance on Saturday Night Live in April 1994, just eight days after the death of Nirvana frontman and grunge pioneer Kurt Cobain. A tribute to Cobain, it is called 'Daughter/Hey Hey, My My' by fans, since the extension is from the Neil Young song 'Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)', which Cobain's suicide note had quoted. Another popular tag of the song is the 'It's Okay' tag, which includes a slow improvisation based on 'It's Okay' by garage rock band Dead Moon.Live performances of 'Daughter' can be found on the 'Dissident'/Live in Atlanta box set, the live album Live on Two Legs, various official bootlegs, the live album Live at Benaroya Hall, the live album Live in NYC 12/31/92, the Live at the Gorge 05/06 box set, and the live album Live at Lollapalooza 2007. Performances of the song are also included on the DVDs Touring Band 2000, Live at the Showbox, and Live at the Garden. The version of the song on Live at Lollapalooza 2007, onto which the band tagged Pink Floyd's 'Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2),' features Vedder singing the lyrics 'George Bush leave this world alone/George Bush find yourself another home'. The band discovered that some of the Bush-related lyrics were excised from the AT&T webcast of Lollapalooza 2007, and questioned whether that constituted censorship. AT&T later apologized and blamed the censorship on contractor Davie Brown Entertainment. At the 2014 show in Milan, the band tagged the Disney song 'Let It Go' to the end of the song's performance.""",Why were the Grateful Dead such an influential live band?,train,"[[0.9873649477958679, 0.012635094113647938], [0.9817280769348145, 0.018271924927830696], [0.9573932886123657, 0.04260678216814995], [0.9708124399185181, 0.029187573119997978], [0.8581615686416626, 0.1418384164571762], [0.9378390312194824, 0.06216096878051758], [0.7161585092544556, 0.28384146094322205], [0.9823340177536011, 0.017666032537817955], [0.9718992114067078, 0.028100715950131416], [0.8271023035049438, 0.17289768159389496], [0.9553501605987549, 0.04464986175298691], [0.976630687713623, 0.023369379341602325]]","[[2.348099708557129, -2.0104615688323975], [2.164797306060791, -1.8191512823104858], [1.7278013229370117, -1.3843992948532104], [1.9113662242889404, -1.5930238962173462], [1.0650310516357422, -0.7350728511810303], [1.5061546564102173, -1.2076961994171143], [0.6720812320709229, -0.253404438495636], [2.1788339614868164, -1.8394538164138794], [1.950797200202942, -1.5926597118377686], [0.9652297496795654, -0.5999987721443176], [1.689723014831543, -1.3735036849975586], [2.039029121398926, -1.693652868270874]]",0.28384146094322205,0.07310215764058133

He had recently attended a Fleetwood Mac show and visited the band members back stage after the show. The visit reconnected him with Mick Fleetwood, his ex-band mate and ex-manager, after being estranged for many years. (He had never been estranged from Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, who were not parties to the lawsuit.) By 2003, Welch believed that he had been snubbed by the Hall as the directors in New York, music industry insiders, did not like his style of music. However, he did believe that the lawsuit was a factor in his being blackballed, as it prevented him from getting in touch with Mick Fleetwood, whom he was not talking to at the time of the induction, who may have otherwise have used his influence to get Welch included with other members of the band. For example, Jerry Garcia had used his influence to get 12 members of the Grateful Dead inducted into the Hall, including some members whose contributions were considered marginal. As the Plain Dealer article noted, 16 members of the Parliament-Funkadelic collective were inducted into the Rock Hall—an oddly large number in the author's view, considering Welch's pivotal role in Fleetwood Mac and a board member's contention that only band members who made important creative contributions to a group's sound and impact are nominated for inclusion.",Why were the Grateful Dead such an influential live band?,train,"[[0.9448121190071106, 0.055187925696372986], [0.9762139916419983, 0.02378602884709835], [0.9750490188598633, 0.0249510295689106], [0.9671817421913147, 0.03281832113862038], [0.883247435092926, 0.11675258725881577], [0.8323456048965454, 0.1676543653011322], [0.5222651362419128, 0.47773483395576477], [0.9241026043891907, 0.07589734345674515]]","[[1.592530369758606, -1.247711420059204], [2.038780927658081, -1.6758025884628296], [2.008148193359375, -1.6574243307113647], [1.8651210069656372, -1.5182784795761108], [1.1752305030822754, -0.8483178615570068], [0.9764382839202881, -0.6259050369262695], [0.1603965163230896, 0.07127697020769119], [1.4117658138275146, -1.0876755714416504]]",0.47773483395576477,0.12184780440293252

It has been reported that the band's label, Warner Bros., did not know how to market Montrose, and, already having the Doobie Brothers and Deep Purple to cover the rock and hard rock genres, saw the band as something of a redundancy on their roster of artists. Though the album was not a big seller upon its initial release, peaking at No. 133 on the U.S. Billboard chart, it eventually proved to be an international sleeper hit which over a period of several decades has sold in excess of one million copies, attaining platinum status. Some critics have arguably labeled it the 'first American heavy metal album'. Often cited as 'America's answer to Led Zeppelin', it is held to be highly influential amongst hard rock/heavy metal musicians including Iron Maiden, who have recorded and/or performed cover versions of songs from the album. 'Space Station #5' was released as the B-side of their single 'Be Quick or Be Dead' (1992).",Did the Grateful Dead have a number one hit?,train,"[[0.9789766073226929, 0.021023310720920563], [0.981896162033081, 0.018103813752532005], [0.9840906262397766, 0.015909340232610703], [0.9882194995880127, 0.011780506931245327], [0.956200122833252, 0.04379991441965103], [0.9891654849052429, 0.010834518820047379], [0.9894098043441772, 0.010590195655822754], [0.9612433314323425, 0.038756657391786575]]","[[2.0956759452819824, -1.7451999187469482], [2.1678524017333984, -1.8255105018615723], [2.2436258792877197, -1.8811856508255005], [2.3600964546203613, -2.069362163543701], [1.69089674949646, -1.3924387693405151], [2.4224917888641357, -2.091632604598999], [2.4242630004882812, -2.112917184829712], [1.7784079313278198, -1.4325172901153564]]",0.04379991441965103,0.021349782240577042

In many aviation regulations and AFMs, V is listed as V though, with the addition that V is the minimum control speed for the takeoff configuration.  However, during other flight phases, such as continued takeoff after flap retraction, cruise flight and approach for landing when the flaps are still up, a V applies as well. Therefore most test pilot schools teach to use V, rather than V, and include the airplane configuration or flight phase with it. Other defined Vs are minimum control speed on the ground (V) and minimum control speed during approach and landing (V).  In addition, on four or more engine airplanes, Vs exist for cases with either one or two engines inoperative (on the same wing).

Although their studio albums enjoyed only modest success, and they were never an AM-radio favorite, 'The Dead' attracted an enormous cult following, mainly on the strength of their live performances (and live albums). Drawing inspiration from Eric Clapton's short-lived (but influential) supergroup Cream, the band specialized, in concert, in improvisational jamming. They played long two-set shows, and gave their fans a different experience every night, with varying setlists, evolving songs, creative segues and extended instrumentals. Their loyal fans ('Deadheads') followed them on tour from city to city, and a hippie subculture developed around the band, complete with psychedelic clothes, a black market in concert-related products, and drug paraphernalia. The band toured regularly for nearly three decades, except for a hiatus from 1974-1976. The eventual heirs to this 'Shakedown Street' fan culture, Phish, formed in 1983 at the University of Vermont in Burlington. They solidified their lineup in 1985, and began their career with a few Grateful Dead songs in their repertoire.",Who wrote Cassidy?,train,"[[0.87424236536026, 0.1257576197385788], [0.9930944442749023, 0.006905617658048868], [0.7012223601341248, 0.29877769947052], [0.9952955842018127, 0.004704466089606285], [0.9907909631729126, 0.009209091775119305], [0.9955262541770935, 0.0044736904092133045], [0.9901455044746399, 0.009854456409811974], [0.9952050447463989, 0.004795001354068518]]","[[1.131935715675354, -0.8070656061172485], [2.6353492736816406, -2.333141565322876], [0.6211614012718201, -0.2319638729095459], [2.812065362930298, -2.542462110519409], [2.4905800819396973, -2.187731981277466], [2.845075845718384, -2.5599822998046875], [2.4514150619506836, -2.158512830734253], [2.800848960876465, -2.5345261096954346]]",0.29877769947052,0.058059705363120884

Handlen writes against the views of Cornet on the development of Carol and Tyreese somewhat in this episode, explaining that the reveal that Carol killed and burnt David and Karen was 'unconvincing' and that 'it seems like a drastic leap for the character, and one that a few conversations about knives isn’t going to cover.' On the development of Tyreese, Handlen describes his plot line as 'clunky in spots.' However, Handlen contrasts this point by explaining that though his behavior, particularly his fight scene with Rick at the beginning, is somewhat over the top, it does show us a 'sense that frustrated violence must be lurking behind the everyday behavior of so many of these characters.' More positively, he writes that the element of isolation involving the quarantined characters was effective, especially when main characters such as Glenn showed signs of the illness. He adds that the chance to see some of the show's main characters step up and try to save others in their hour of need was great to watch, particularly Hershel. Of Hershel's act to go and find some herbs to make tea to help the sick, Handlen remarks: 'It’s a small (and potentially fatal) gesture, but the dignity of it, and Hershel’s refusal to back down when everyone else tells him he’s risking his life, is noteworthy. In a way, it’s the exact opposite of Carol’s choice.'",What else did John Barlow and Bob Weir write?,train,"[[0.9935027956962585, 0.0064971959218382835], [0.9945693612098694, 0.005430583842098713], [0.9801669716835022, 0.01983305998146534], [0.987297773361206, 0.012702289037406445], [0.9886444807052612, 0.011355540715157986], [0.9833952188491821, 0.016604751348495483], [0.9915870428085327, 0.008412977680563927], [0.9832143783569336, 0.01678561419248581], [0.990774929523468, 0.009225028567016125]]","[[2.6554832458496094, -2.374382972717285], [2.7361953258514404, -2.4740676879882812], [2.1099414825439453, -1.790431261062622], [2.330477476119995, -2.022711992263794], [2.3844122886657715, -2.082216501235962], [2.1955995559692383, -1.8857227563858032], [2.532874584197998, -2.236656665802002], [2.194383382797241, -1.875921368598938], [2.4863314628601074, -2.1902356147766113]]",0.01983305998146534,0.011871893476280902

The label, primarily known for releasing R&B material, signed the band in an effort to incorporate a new marketing opportunity. The band went to record their debut single in Ter Mer Studios, located in Chicago. The single, both conceived of original material by Borkenhagen, was produced by Ralph Bass. In June 1967, the band released their debut single, 'Mary Jane' b/w  'Iowa, A Girl's Name', which was banned by locals radio stations within a week of the release for perceived pro-drug references. In reality, there were no pro-drug references and, ironically, the A-side, 'Mary Jane', was intended as an anti-drug statement. The controversary brought regional acclaim for the band, and they became known for their eccentric live performances. Following the banning of their single, the band released their only LP, The Baroques, which included the two songs from the single. The album became a regional hit, but the band was unable to branch out of state as their label was not well-known to distribute rock albums, let alone psychedelic rock. Still, the band was at its peak of popularity and was performing in an increased amount of gigs, but Chess Records dropped them from their label. One final self-financed effort was produced in 1968, but with the small marketing the single only reached regional acclaim.

In one successful study, witnesses were asked to draw a detailed sketch of what they witnessed while conversing, which proved to be as effective as asking witnesses to mentally reinstate context.  Moreover, the researchers found that witnesses produced fewer confabulations when sketch was used which led to the belief that the witness’s used their own cues to help them remember rather than relying on the interviewer to direct them towards relevant cues. Therefore, cognitive retrieval is effective in enhancing eyewitness memory retrieval in the police interview. Moreover, according to Tulving and Thomson’s encoding specificity principle, context reinstatement increases the availability of memory-stored information and studies have found the connection between the role played by the CI and this principle. Another study sought out to compare the effectiveness of three interview procedures for optimizing witness memory performance. The cognitive interview, hypnosis interview and standard police interview were used. The results found that both cognitive and hypnosis interviews elicited significantly greater numbers of correct items of information than the standard police interview throughout all instances of the study. The results of the cognitive interview closely replicate those obtained by Geiselman et al.

In his theory, Robert K. Merton focused on English Puritanism and German Pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries.

Richards, especially his  Practical Criticism and The Meaning of Meaning, which offered what was claimed to be an empirical scientific approach, were important to the development of New Critical methodology. Also very influential were the critical essays of T. S.

In a study conducted by Karpicke and Bauernschmidt used this principle to determine the major differences between the different types of retrieval. The two focused on studying long term retention by testing participants over the course of one week. The participants were either assigned to a uniform schedule or an expanding schedule. No matter what type of spacing was assigned to the ninety-six participants, each completed three repeated tests at the end of their rehearsal intervals. Once those tests were completed, participants came back one week later to complete a final retention test. The researchers concluded that it did not matter what kind of retrieval schedule was used.

One of the simplest ways to do this is asking open-ended questions. Open-ended questions such as 'Tell me about a time when….' or 'How might this information be useful to you?' cause learners to think about how new information may relate to their own experience.  Student responses to such questions are opportunities for experiencing the perspectives of others.  For these questions to be effective it is critical that instructors focus on teaching content that is useful for participants.  The importance of using these types of strategies with adults contributes to what  Bain(2004 p. 4) noted as critical learning environments where instructors 'embed' the skills they are teaching in 'authentic tasks that will arouse curiosity, challenge students to rethink assumptions and examine their mental modes of reality'. Mezirow J. (1997) who asserts that learners need to practice in recognizing frames of reference and using their imaginations to redefine problems from different perspectives. (pg. 10) I made the connection by also adding the point that 'to promote discovery learning, the educator often reframes learner questions in terms of the learner’s current level of understanding. Learning contracts, group projects, role play, case studies, and simulations are classroom methods associated with transformative education.' Such approaches emphasize that learning is not an 'all or nothing' process but that students learn the new information that is presented to them by building upon knowledge that they already possess.  It is therefore important that teachers constantly assess the knowledge their students have gained to make sure that the students' perceptions of the new knowledge are what the teacher had intended.  Teachers will find that since the students build upon already existing knowledge, when they are called upon to retrieve the new information, they may make errors.  It is known as reconstruction error when we fill in the gaps of our understanding with logical, though incorrect, thoughts.  Teachers need to catch and try to correct these errors, though it is inevitable that some reconstruction error will continue to occur because of our innate retrieval limitations.",What is TREC for information retrieval research?,validation,"[[0.9804601073265076, 0.019539905712008476], [0.9726022481918335, 0.02739778347313404], [0.9752582907676697, 0.024741683155298233], [0.9338247179985046, 0.06617527455091476], [0.9724090099334717, 0.027591027319431305], [0.9843863844871521, 0.015613608062267303], [0.969971239566803, 0.0300288125872612], [0.976127564907074, 0.0238723773509264], [0.9727229475975037, 0.027277033776044846], [0.9555597901344299, 0.04444020986557007], [0.9798760414123535, 0.020123939961194992], [0.9376391172409058, 0.06236090138554573], [0.9768945574760437, 0.023105522617697716], [0.9631237983703613, 0.03687619790434837], [0.9814977645874023, 0.01850229874253273], [0.9660150408744812, 0.03398497402667999], [0.9596694707870483, 0.040330518037080765], [0.985122561454773, 0.014877473935484886]]","[[2.1268258094787598, -1.788737416267395], [1.9483023881912231, -1.6212106943130493], [1.9955767393112183, -1.6786361932754517], [1.4774978160858154, -1.1694841384887695], [1.9421460628509521, -1.6201399564743042], [2.238025665283203, -1.905849814414978], [1.9160200357437134, -1.5590890645980835], [2.025272846221924, -1.6855982542037964], [1.9522504806518555, -1.621803879737854], [1.7022472620010376, -1.3659054040908813], [2.112539291381836, -1.7729766368865967], [1.5183526277542114, -1.192073941230774], [2.0341317653656006, -1.7101751565933228], [1.8067573308944702, -1.4558583498001099], [2.1559362411499023, -1.8152486085891724], [1.8435667753219604, -1.5036940574645996], [1.7459713220596313, -1.4235092401504517], [2.2576844692230225, -1.935233473777771]]",0.06617527455091476,0.030935530136856768

In one successful study, witnesses were asked to draw a detailed sketch of what they witnessed while conversing, which proved to be as effective as asking witnesses to mentally reinstate context.  Moreover, the researchers found that witnesses produced fewer confabulations when sketch was used which led to the belief that the witness’s used their own cues to help them remember rather than relying on the interviewer to direct them towards relevant cues. Therefore, cognitive retrieval is effective in enhancing eyewitness memory retrieval in the police interview. Moreover, according to Tulving and Thomson’s encoding specificity principle, context reinstatement increases the availability of memory-stored information and studies have found the connection between the role played by the CI and this principle. Another study sought out to compare the effectiveness of three interview procedures for optimizing witness memory performance. The cognitive interview, hypnosis interview and standard police interview were used. The results found that both cognitive and hypnosis interviews elicited significantly greater numbers of correct items of information than the standard police interview throughout all instances of the study. The results of the cognitive interview closely replicate those obtained by Geiselman et al. (1984), in which participants were interviewed about a classroom intrusion using a structured questionnaire. Again, more correct items of information were generated with the cognitive interview than with the control interview, and without an increase in the number of incorrect items.

Transfer-appropriate processing (TAP) argues that to have memory successfully recalled there needs to be a successful encoding process.  There has been an argument among cognitive psychologists that suggests that the encoding process and retrieval processes are substantially similar.  In an experiment that tested TAP researchers found this argument to ring true. They found that successful memory retrieval backs up the encoding process, which therefore has a similar effect on both the retrieval and encoding function.  This experiment also pointed out that there are certain variables to consider when looking at TAP because they greatly limit the effectiveness of the retrieval and encoding processes. They believed that to change TAP into a broader form, you would have to question whether the two processing forms actually coincide.  Also, TAP is an information-processing action that occurs in two stages; the first includes the procedures that should manipulate the information that coincides with the task activity, and the second stage focuses on the experience that the task activity created.

Roughly, it is the view that there are independent moral standards: some actions are right or wrong in themselves, independent of God's commands. This is the view accepted by Socrates and Euthyphro in Plato's dialogue. The Mu'tazilah school of Islamic theology also defended the view (with, for example, Nazzam maintaining that God is powerless to engage in injustice or lying), as did the Islamic philosopher Averroes. Thomas Aquinas never explicitly addresses the Euthyphro dilemma, but Aquinas scholars often put him on this side of the issue. Aquinas draws a distinction between what is good or evil in itself and what is good or evil because of God's commands, with unchangeable moral standards forming the bulk of natural law. Thus he contends that not even God can change the Ten Commandments (adding, however, that God can change what individuals deserve in particular cases, in what might look like special dispensations to murder or steal). Among later Scholastics, Gabriel Vásquez is particularly clear-cut about obligations existing prior to anyone's will, even God's. Modern natural law theory saw Grotius and Leibniz also putting morality prior to God's will, comparing moral truths to unchangeable mathematical truths, and engaging voluntarists like Pufendorf in philosophical controversy. Cambridge Platonists like Benjamin Whichcote and Ralph Cudworth mounted seminal attacks on voluntarist theories, paving the way for the later rationalist metaethics of Samuel Clarke and Richard Price; what emerged was a view on which eternal moral standards, though dependent on God in some way, exist independently of God's will and prior to God's commands. Contemporary philosophers of religion who embrace this horn of the Euthyphro dilemma include Richard Swinburne and T. J. Mawson (though see below for complications).",e-Discovery?

Often, users are uncertain about their exact medical situations, are unfamiliar with medical terminology, and hence have difficulty in coming up with the right search keywords. An intelligent medical search engine is specifically designed to address this challenge. It uses several techniques to improve its usability and search result quality. First, it uses an interactive questionnaire-based query interface to guide users to provide the most important information about their situations. Users perform search by selecting symptoms and answering questions rather than by typing keyword queries. Second, it uses medical knowledge (e.g., diagnostic decision trees) to automatically form multiple queries from a user' answers to the questions. These queries are used to perform search simultaneously. Third, it provides various kinds of help functions. For instance, if a user has made incorrect selections, does not know which symptoms to select, or cannot answer a question, he or she can invoke the search engine's help functionality and describe his or her health situation there. Then he or she will see multiple lists of help information, e.g., one list for relevance of unselected symptoms, and another list for relevance of alternate responses (to his or her selections).

The proximity of the epicenter of Kilwa Kisiwani to Songo Mnara is a perfect area to look at for geoarchaeological research. The limited occupation makes it possible for researchers to understand what exactly was happening. Songo Mnara, in the 2011 field school, had samples sent for soil analysis looking at the sediments found and what was deposited during the time period that people were occupying the site. In order to do that, the geoarchaeologists looked at microstratigraphy chemical and phytolith analyses to complete the bigger picture of what was deposited naturally and what was deposited by people living at the site. Two open spaces were tested: one at the north end of Songo Mnara, and one at the south end. In order to tell the difference of what was being shown, a reference sample was taken from the area. More samples were also taken from the rooms that had fill in them and the floors of the houses.The open areas showed two different kinds of sediment found, one being the sediment normal for the region. The other was located in areas where there were a lot of activity, just a patch of it within the testing area. When looking at house 44, a great number of palm phytoliths were found, which is not a natural occurrence.

To date, there is no complainant in the case. Since all the accused persons denied the allegations against them and there is no complainant, there is no way the allegations can be proved.” This was the submission of the prosecuting police officer!

Zimmerman was the neighborhood watch coordinator for the gated community where Martin was temporarily staying and where the shooting took place. The Twin Lakes Neighborhood Watch program was not registered with the National Neighborhood Watch Program, but was administered by the local police department. Following an earlier call from Zimmerman, police arrived within two minutes of a gunshot during an altercation in which Zimmerman fatally shot Martin, who did not possess any weapons. Zimmerman was subsequently taken into custody, treated for head injuries, then questioned for five hours. The police chief said that Zimmerman was released because there was no evidence to refute Zimmerman's claim of having acted in self-defense, and that under Florida's Stand Your Ground statute, the police were prohibited by law from making an arrest.

This anti-inebriation movement had been developing in punk prior to Minor Threat, but their song 'Straight Edge' was influential in giving the scene a name, and something of a (somewhat unwilling) figurehead. Minor Threat frontman Ian MacKaye is often credited with birthing the Straight edge name and movement and in later years has often spoken out about how he never intended it to be a movement. 'I'm credited because I coined a phrase and wrote a song about it. I'm not going to spend any more energy than I already have explaining that. From the very beginning I've tried to say that this is not my opinion. That whole thing just makes me realize I don't have any control over what people think of me. And I don't really give a fuck. I think that the idea of straight edge, the song that I wrote, and the way people have related it, there's some people who have abused it, they've allowed their fundamentalism to interfere with the real message, which in my mind, was that people should be allowed to live their lives the way they want to.

Garza, Cullors and Tometi met through 'Black Organizing for Leadership & Dignity' (BOLD), a national organization that trains community organizers.

There’s going to be some interesting clues about his past, but will any of these lead us to be convinced he’s a cold-blooded killer?'

She said Silas was left alone with 'the dodgy doc, and the next thing they knew the old man had knocked Browning out, stolen his shoes and run away. Come on, are we really expected to believe Silas could take out young, strong Dr B alone? Or is this evidence they’re working together...?' After it was revealed Doctor Browning killed Lynsey, Morgan said she 'had the dastardly doc's card marked from day one, but have to admit that tonight's big reveal has left us a bit cold'.

While on coming back from his usual fishing and hunting round he hears crying and decides to help he goes inside the yurt to see 2 children. The eldest one Tim approached Turgen and with all his kindness stayed to tend to the youngest child Aska as she was only but an infant. As time past Marfa the mother of the children came from working to see Turgen tending to her children rather than being angry she was just surprised to find him in her home. As it turns out one of the people who didn't listen to the shamans words was Marfa's late husband who left marfa with some enlightening information that turgen was a kind man that helped anyone that needed and that the shaman only spoke lies and this was proven to her as she came to see him tending to her children.From that point he frequently dropped by to see Marfa and he children bringing them meats, and salts to make sure that marfa did not need to work so hard and with that she was able to spend more time with her children. With these visits Turgen's story about his past affiliation with the rams on how he hunted them for sport and that cause great sorrow in him to see these creatures being hunter for their horns and meats even though they were minding their own business. With this gap of trust between them Turgen set out to create a wall of trust with the ram which he achieved by feeding them every day. As time passed he began to bond with the herd of ram and watched them as they at his food offering and when the rams had encounters with other dangerous creatures like bears and wolves Turgen did everything in his power to help the rams with their fight even if it meant risking his life.

This is when Marfa stood up and pleaded to hunter to listen to reason and why Turgen had see the rams through. As they listen they were reminded of the shamans words and ignored er words this is when Turgen stood and talk sense to the hunter and told them how the shamans words should not be headed since he was visited by spirit for helping the rams as the Lamut were very religious they believed a spirit haunted Turgen and now believed he was free since the rams were gone.

The idea of this new alliance has already drawn interest from the Democrats in the US and is also a reminder that no country will be more aligned with US foreign policy goals under Biden than Britain.  NATO is usually a tricky issue for France, and Germany’s strong economic relationship with China complicates its attitude to Beijing.

Such droughts also impose costs in terms of wildfires, both in terms of control costs and lost timber and related resources.  Water users will eventually adapt to more frequent and severe droughts, in part by shifting limited water supplies towards higher-value uses.  Such shifts could be from low- to high-value crops, or from agricultural and industrial to environmental and municipal uses.  A period of delay is likely, however, because gradual changes in the frequency and severity of drought will be difficult to distinguish from normal inter-annual variations in precipitation.  Economic losses will be larger during this period of delay, as compared to a world with instantaneous adjustment, but preemptive adaptation could also be costly given the uncertainty surrounding future climate.  Rising surface temperatures are expected to increase the proportion of winter precipitation received as rain, with a declining proportion arriving in the form of snow.

These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing.   Effects of global warming include rising sea levels, regional changes in precipitation, more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, and expansion of deserts.  Surface temperature increases are greatest in the Arctic, with the continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice.  Overall, higher temperatures bring more rain and snowfall, but for some regions droughts and wildfires increase instead.  Climate change threatens to diminish crop yields, harming food security, and rising sea levels may flood costal infrastructure and eventually force the abandonment of many coastal cities.  Environmental impacts include the extinction or relocation of many species as their ecosystems change, most immediately the environments of coral reefs, mountains, and the Arctic.

This figure shows the mean annual air temperature from 1815 to date as recorded at the Radcliffe Meteorological Station.  Two interesting facts are apparent from the Radcliffe temperature time series: In the 20th century temperatures were generally higher than in the 19th century.  This is thought to be an effect of the urban heat island.  With the development of the city, more open spaces were built up.  This process produced radical changes in the nature of the surface and atmospheric properties of the city.  Differences in surface materials, drainage characteristics, sources of heat, configuration of surfaces and pollution acted to change all aspects of the climate of the city, air temperature being affected particularly strongly.  Urban heat island effect is the most common example of inadvertent climatic modification.  The post-1986 decade was the warmest decade on record.  This fact may be an effect of the interannual climatic variability, or it may be suggestive of climate change.  Only time will tell!

By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, according to UN-Water.  The lack of water poses a major threat to several sectors, including food security.  Agriculture uses about 70% of the world’s accessible freshwater.  Developing countries are most affected by water shortages, flooding and poor water quality.  Up to 80% of illnesses in the developing world are linked to inadequate water and sanitation.  In many countries, pollution or rising sea levels are contaminating trusted water sources.  Water stress and lack of sanitation disproportionately affect women and girls.

As the common but differentiated responsibilities principles recognize, it will clearly be in the interests of developing countries to continue do these things (and more) as they face enormous consequences from climate change if they do not.  The economic, political and technology choices thus have a more important bearing on climate change than “over population.”  Back to top Pollution For Others Pollution and emissions are related to consumption, not just population numbers alone.  While pollution is increasing in poorer countries as well, it is not solely due to rising populations, because, as the U.N. points out, and as mentioned earlier, 80% of the world’s resources are consumed by the world’s wealthiest 20%.  Hence, even if pollution is occurring in poor countries, a large portion of it is to meet this consumer demand.  In its September 2008 issue, the journal Energy Policy found that around 1/3rd of Chinese carbon dioxide emissions were due to the production of exports and that it is mostly the developed world consuming these.","Okay, but how does climate change affect developing countries?",test,"[[0.5623756051063538, 0.437624454498291], [0.34815654158592224, 0.6518434286117554], [0.663716733455658, 0.33628326654434204], [0.678991973400116, 0.32100799679756165], [0.7370173931121826, 0.262982577085495], [0.6342593431472778, 0.36574068665504456]]","[[0.2010558396577835, -0.04975299537181854], [-0.16209618747234344, 0.46505606174468994], [0.44997328519821167, -0.22992832958698273], [0.5045889616012573, -0.244554340839386], [0.7146993279457092, -0.31582435965538025], [0.36820438504219055, -0.18232905864715576]]",0.6518434286117554,0.3959137350320816

Programs for flood management should consider and  seek to balance these hazardous and beneficial aspects of floods.  Irrigation Irrigated agriculture is important in the developing nations, as it  constitutes about 80 percent of water uses.  Many varieties of irrigated  agriculture are practiced in the developing nations, ranging from  gravity irrigation canal systems to small tanks and tube wells.  Some of  these systems are highly efficient, whereas others are affected by  problems such as leaky delivery systems, salinization, fouled water  supplies (including groundwater, an important source of irrigation), and  inflexible delivery schedules.  A boy in West Bengal, India pumps water from a well in a flooded  area.  Floodwaters can contaminate cisterns and improperly designed  wells, compounding problems caused by the river currents and  inundation.  Deforestation Throughout the developing countries, deforestation is being caused by a  combination of overpopulation, inappropriate land use practices, and  inadequate environmental regulations and enforcement.  Soil erosion is a  natural process, but deforestation and other human activities have  resulted in a fivefold increase in the average levels of sediment  carried in the world's rivers.","Okay, but how does climate change affect developing countries?",test,"[[0.8260894417762756, 0.17391055822372437], [0.8953149914741516, 0.10468505322933197], [0.7613634467124939, 0.2386365532875061], [0.776348888874054, 0.22365117073059082], [0.7451329231262207, 0.2548670768737793], [0.9233496189117432, 0.07665041834115982], [0.8422255516052246, 0.15777438879013062], [0.25696638226509094, 0.7430335879325867], [0.8756099939346313, 0.12438999116420746]]","[[0.9426652193069458, -0.615496814250946], [1.2065024375915527, -0.9397169351577759], [0.7950527667999268, -0.36511632800102234], [0.8318811655044556, -0.41263335943222046], [0.735918402671814, -0.33690208196640015], [1.3715275526046753, -1.1172252893447876], [0.9938106536865234, -0.6810709834098816], [-0.3682566285133362, 0.6935392618179321], [1.1162253618240356, -0.8352737426757812]]",0.7430335879325867,0.23306653317477968

This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa or Small Island Developing States.  Some of those island states are likely to face total inundation.  Fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, and Somalia are among the worst affected.   Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.  These effects are most severe for the world’s poorest countries.   A changing climate also results in economic burdens.  The economies in Least Developed Countries have lost an average of 7% of their gross domestic product for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced labor productivity.

NICs usually benefit from comparatively low wage costs, which translates into lower input prices for suppliers.  As a result, it is often easier for producers in NICs to outperform and outproduce factories in developed countries, where the cost of living is higher, and trade unions and other organizations have more political sway.  This comparative advantage is often criticized by advocates of the fair trade movement.   Critics of NICs argue economic freedom is not always associated with political freedom in countries such as China, pointing out that Internet censorship and human rights violations are common.",Are developed countries meeting their pledges to provide climate financial support to developing countries in the Paris Agreement?,validation,"[[0.2519761919975281, 0.7480238676071167], [0.2181343138217926, 0.781865656375885], [0.9719488620758057, 0.028051156550645828], [0.5118784308433533, 0.4881216585636139], [0.7990443110466003, 0.20095562934875488], [0.37018904089927673, 0.6298109292984009], [0.9823811650276184, 0.017618775367736816], [0.5042546391487122, 0.49574539065361023], [0.3015916645526886, 0.6984083652496338], [0.7692341208457947, 0.23076589405536652], [0.5780543684959412, 0.42194560170173645]]","[[-0.39411497116088867, 0.6939853429794312], [-0.48105165362358093, 0.7955203056335449], [1.9289480447769165, -1.6163251399993896], [0.1602531224489212, 0.11273059993982315], [0.8835628032684326, -0.4967694878578186], [-0.10883346199989319, 0.42257243394851685], [2.1570942401885986, -1.863919734954834], [0.11136455833911896, 0.09434562176465988], [-0.27707937359809875, 0.5626506805419922], [0.7892236709594727, -0.41476792097091675], [0.23450276255607605, -0.08028876036405563]]",0.781865656375885,0.431028447706591

With their decisions on adaptation, deforestation, and technology, governments addressed key developing country concerns and laid important groundwork for a post-2012 agreement.  Ultimately, these and other elements need to be integrated in a comprehensive package spelling out specific binding commitments for all the major economies.  In 2009, a new political accord was indeed struck by world leaders at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen.  The Copenhagen Accord provided for explicit emission pledges by all the major economies – including, for the first time, China and other major developing countries.  Meeting the next year in Cancún, Mexico, leaders built upon the 2009 Accord.  The Cancún agreement formalizes the fundamental elements of the Copenhagen Accord and starts to implement them.

A report by the Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) (2011) takes a political economy approach to explain why some countries adopt climate change policies while others do not, specifically among the countries in the transition region.  This work analyzes the different political economy aspects of the characteristics of climate change policies so as to understand the likely factors driving climate change mitigation outcomes in many transition countries.  The main conclusions are listed below:  BULLET::::- The level of democracy alone is not a major driver of climate change policy adoption, which means that the expectations of contribution to global climate change mitigation are not necessarily limited by the political regime of a given country.   BULLET::::- Public knowledge, shaped by various factors including the threat of climate change in a particular country, the national level of education and existence of free media, is a critical element in climate change policy adoption, as countries with the public more aware of the climate change causes are significantly more likely to adopt climate change policies.",So what happens at each Conference of Parties?,train,"[[0.9312270879745483, 0.06877297163009644], [0.9410698413848877, 0.058930136263370514], [0.9481953978538513, 0.05180460214614868], [0.9343875646591187, 0.06561248749494553], [0.8553923964500427, 0.14460763335227966]]","[[1.4460326433181763, -1.1596598625183105], [1.5288358926773071, -1.2418287992477417], [1.601306676864624, -1.3057748079299927], [1.4632397890090942, -1.1928855180740356], [1.0440975427627563, -0.7334386706352234]]",0.14460763335227966,0.07794556617736817

This, and distributional conflict, led to failures of subsequent international climate negotiations.  The 2009 round of negotiations were intended to produce a successor treaty of Kyoto, but the resulting Copenhagen Accord was not legally binding and did not get adopted universally.  The Accord did lay the framework for bottom-up approach of what would become the Paris Agreement.  Under the leadership of UNFCCC executive secretary Christiana Figueres, negotiation regained momentum after Copenhagen's failure.

And both offer more ambitious proposals for tackling climate change than any U.S. president ever has.  But beyond that, the former vice president and the independent senator from Vermont have divergingproposals about how exactly — and how quickly — to try to cut the country’s contributions to global warming.  Here are the biggest differences on the issues, as voters head to the polls in Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington next Tuesday:  1.  Gas: The declining cost and growing availability of gas because of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has helped lead to the closure of hundreds of power plants that burn coal — the dirtiest of all fossil fuels.

Right now, the Paris Agreement is the only thing we have in terms of a globally recognised climate change plan.  Controversy Around Carbon Credits There are a lot of arguments out there about carbon credits and why they do not work and the data actually backs it up, to a point.  Actually, the emission of carbon dioxide has actually risen 25% since the implementation of the ‘cap and trade’ system.  There is one popular argument surrounding carbon credits.  That the current trading system encourages companies to sell carbon emissions allowances they would not normally use.  Meaning that wealthy companies that go over their allowance find it fairly easy and economical to pollute more if they choose to.  The point of this argument is that the current trading system does not work.  Wealthy companies will just buy more carbon credits and ignore their quota.  So, wouldn’t a different system be better?  Like instead of companies being able to buy more carbon credits, companies should only be allowed to buy carbon offsets.

HFCs may not be ozone depleting gases, but they contribute to global warming, and R134a has more global warming potential than other HFCs, such as R152a.",How are the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement different?,test,"[[0.9653723835945129, 0.03462764620780945], [0.9525343179702759, 0.04746565595269203], [0.9720444083213806, 0.027955632656812668], [0.9496031403541565, 0.0503968819975853], [0.989825427532196, 0.010174565017223358], [0.9723506569862366, 0.02764936164021492], [0.9597572088241577, 0.04024277627468109], [0.9870026111602783, 0.012997470796108246], [0.910244345664978, 0.08975568413734436], [0.9362846612930298, 0.06371533125638962]]","[[1.797845482826233, -1.5300160646438599], [1.6331778764724731, -1.3659418821334839], [1.9163745641708374, -1.6324082612991333], [1.6022976636886597, -1.3338172435760498], [2.417344808578491, -2.160292863845825], [1.9307020902633667, -1.6294118165969849], [1.723767638206482, -1.4479821920394897], [2.301954507827759, -2.027963399887085], [1.2950395345687866, -1.0215822458267212], [1.4716171026229858, -1.2158770561218262]]",0.08975568413734436,0.0404981005936861

Elon Musk said he would leave the president’s advisory council, while politicians and pundits framed the move as reckless by highlighting the two other countries whose leadership refused to sign the accord: Syria and Nicaragua.  The message was clear: The United States — once a world leader that sat at the front of the class — has relegated itself to the back of the room with the world’s perceived outliers.  Some commenters noted that even Uzbekistan, a onetime Paris holdout that is home to one of the worst ecological disasters on the planet, signed the climate agreement last month.  The problem with the comparison, and the implicit developed-world condescension it contains, is the glaring absence of context.  Syria didn’t sign the agreement because the country remains locked in a protracted civil war that the United Nations estimates may have displaced 12 million people and resulted in more than 250,000 deaths.  Meanwhile, Nicaraguan leaders said they declined to enter the Paris agreement not because they didn’t want to abide by new emissions standards but because those standards weren’t strict enough and didn’t require enough sacrifice from wealthier countries with larger economies, according to Reuters.",Why did President Trump intend to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement?,train,"[[0.7127295732498169, 0.2872704863548279], [0.5967161655426025, 0.40328383445739746], [0.9211399555206299, 0.07886001467704773], [0.9819674491882324, 0.018032539635896683], [0.925794243812561, 0.07420574873685837], [0.9770301580429077, 0.022969890385866165], [0.6627246737480164, 0.33727532625198364]]","[[0.6217770576477051, -0.2869008183479309], [0.28576159477233887, -0.10603930801153183], [1.371193766593933, -1.086743950843811], [2.1454179286956787, -1.8519622087478638], [1.3966479301452637, -1.1271623373031616], [2.0254340171813965, -1.724899411201477], [0.4486064910888672, -0.22685354948043823]]",0.40328383445739746,0.1745568343571254

Baylor was not being considered by any major conference as a potential member due to its poor overall football performance as a Big 12 member (the 2010 season was the first year that the program finished at .500 in conference play, and only the second time that it had not finished last or tied for last in its division).

Europe is racing to finalize an even more ambitious target in advance of this week’s summit, and, following the November election, the United States appears poised to follow suit.  If these countries follow through — a big “if” — these moves could put the world within a hair of reaching the Paris agreement’s goals.  Does this mean the treaty is working?

The hamper in the photo below includes homemade choc-chip cookies and homemade truffles that have been packaged in DIY boxes.  If you make great jam or chutney or have a secret spice mix, don’t buy it, make it yourself.  People really appreciate the time and effort you spend making things (and they enjoy your wares as well).  I once made up “gift pack” hampers for a couple of young girls to make their own cards.  I included scrapbooking supplies, cardstock, embellishments etc., that I already had on hand and supplemented these with a couple of glitter pens and some stickers, embellishments etc. from the $2 shop.  It ended up being a really well-received gift (their mother said they spent hours crafting) and only cost a few dollars.  These were packed in recycled plastic sleeves that you get packs of speciality paper in and I made up a label in Word with card making instructions/hints to go in the pack.

Wide leg holes mean a more comfy fit for baby, but more of a chance that moisture will escape from the leg holes.  Pampers make a breathable diaper, with its patented Air Channels™ that keeps wetness away from the body and allow air to circulate through.  Moms especially love this feature as it means less chance of diaper rash for baby.  Pampers are the most used newborn diapers in hospitals, so many moms are introduced to the brand just after a baby is born.  Pampers come with a wetness indicator that will alert you when its time to change the baby’s diaper.  This pattern on the front of the diaper will change color when wet, making it easy for parents to get baby out of a wet diaper quickly.  With a blanket-like softness, the brand claims that babies sleep better with dry skin while wearing Pampers.

Not only was it practical - a mama can never have too many diapers!  - but it was also thoughtful and made with love.  It was actually one of the things that inspired me to start this blog!  Today I'm partnering with Pampers to share with you how to make a beautiful, rustic looking diaper cake gift for the next baby shower you attend.  My method doesn't involve any diaper rolling, and I've added a unique topper that I think takes this gift to an adorable level.  Take it from a mama of three girls - a mom can only have so many frilly outfits and blankets for her baby, but she can never have too many diapers!

I think you were closer to your dad in your initial years as I read on your blog, but I think after him your closeness to your mom must have increased.  And this is what mostly happens- that we are closer to one parent when we our young and later the closeness for both parents develops.  I was perhaps always close to my mom, though later the closeness for both became more – much more for my dad after my mom.  It’s the feelings that really matter and as you are going to be with your mom next Friday for the weekend, and help her with her birthday celebrations and take her for the reunion, you are doing a great deal for your mom.

Adjust the heating pad control to the warmest setting you can tolerate comfortably.  It should be very warm ('as hot as the body can stand'), but not so hot it burns you.

Homemade specialty detergents can be just as effective as commercial products, if not more.  Most recipes for homemade detergents call for a mix of natural and chemical ingredients.  One popular recipe calls for 3 tablespoons Borax, 3 tablespoons baking soda, and 2 tablespoons Dawn dishwashing liquid.  Add these to 2 cups hot water in a gallon jug and shake until well mixed.  Then, add cold water until the jug is full.  Making your own specialty detergent is also remarkably cost effective.  You could reduce your cost per load of laundry from $.50 to $.03!

One of the easiest things you can do to feel great is get some rest.  If you only have a little time to pamper yourself, get comfortable and take a nap.  If you're setting aside a day of pampering, plan on going to bed early or sleeping in so you can get 7 to 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep.

While making your very first robot your goals should be to just learn all the basics: how to program, how to use the tools, terminology, learn basic technology, and how to get robot parts super cheap.  Save that cool robot idea you have for your second robot.  You can always scrap the first for parts to build the second later.  Trust me .  Ok I am ready, what do I need to start ?  Obviously the first is MONEY.  Robots can get expensive.  A skilled roboticist can build a robot for next to nothing ($50, for example).  He would often have collected enough stuff over the years that he would not have to go and buy most parts.  He also would know how to build his parts instead of buying them pre-made, as well as have the skills to improvise.  However the beginner does not have these options.  You can make most of your robot out of parts in your house, but don't expect to make your first robot McGyver style with just rubber bands and toothpicks.

Any of these substances will have a similar effect on scrubbing away the dead surface skin on your body.  The magnesium in Epsom salts may help to soften skin and does not need to be rinsed off, however.  Other scrubs will have different effects.  Dead Sea salt also will work to soften skin, whereas sea salt can be drying.  Sugar is a milder alternative to salt and works well for older or sensitive skin.  Coffee is a gentle exfoliation alternative as well, and some evidence suggests that it may help smooth cellulite-ridden skin.

Science is often to blame with hot air rising and making upper floors feel hotter, and the construction of your home can also amplify the heat upstairs.  To cool a two-story house effectively, it takes a little investigation to figure out the causes and some simple home cooling tips to keep you comfortable.  Adjust the Dampers Many HVAC systems have dampers, which are platelike structures inside the ductwork, usually close to the furnace.  Each branch leads to a different part of the house, carrying the cooled air to your rooms.  Adjusting the dampers opens or closes them fully or partially to control the airflow.  You can partially close the dampers to areas that stay cold and open them fully to the upstairs rooms that stay hot.",Cool.

1130,1130,5484,133_3-2,0,MARCO_44_2001302180-2,0,Diagnosing Parkinson's disease Managing Parkinson's disease with medications Managing Parkinson's disease with surgery Next lesson Multiple sclerosis Video transcript so in most people right when we're talking about their Parkinson's disease we say that their Parkinson's disease is idiopathic and that just means that we don't know what caused it and that's actually the case for the vast majority of people with Parkinson's disease about eighty-five percent of people so it's a lot right but in a handful of people with Parkinson's disease about 15% we actually do know what caused the disease and for these people something's actually gone wrong with at least one of their genes so a quick recap on genes remember that genes are essentially specific segments of our DNA right so you'd find them in almost every cell in your body so there are specific segments of DNA that provide instructions to the cell and each gene is like a special recipe so each gene has instructions for how to make different proteins and once these proteins are made they go off and they do tons of different tasks tons of different important tasks all around our bodies like well basically everything basically everything is done by proteins from creating our cellular structure to our organs to our enzymes those are proteins to essentially every structure or process in our bodies that you can even think of absolutely everything somehow involves proteins so when something goes wrong with our genes let's say it's supposed to look like this right but maybe due to a mutation a change in that gene it ends up actually looking kind of different so maybe something like this here now all of a sudden the instructions the recipe that that gene has for making their proteins they're not correct anymore right they're not the same and so the proteins that should be made the proteins that we want these genes to make now they can't be made properly anymore at least in cells that have these genes that are affected that are changed that are mutated and when proteins are made properly well they won't be able to carry out their normal roles anymore right so we actually have a collection of genes a family of genes that when they're changed when they're mutated in some 'we can either directly cause or increase our chance of developing Parkinson's disease and this depends on on which gene gets mutated now remember how we get our DNA how we get our chromosomes so we have 23 single chromosomes that we get from our dad and we get another 23 single chromosomes from our mom and they form pairs so we end up with 23 pairs of chromosomes right so that means that we have two copies of each gene right one copy came from your mom and one copy came from your dad now let's actually classify genetic causes of Parkinson's disease into two groups so two types of inheritance if you will so we'll say autosomal dominant over here and and we'll say autosomal recessive over here on this side and this will all start to make sense in a minute here and the inheritance patterns can get really detailed and messy so I'm not going to really go into all of that at the moment but basically I want to get across here that the autosomal dominant types of Parkinson's disease or really any other disease that's inherited in an autosomal dominant way you only really need one bad copy of the gene so either one bad copy from your mom or one bad copy from your dad and that would be enough to cause the disease so in this case in our case that's Parkinson's disease and autosomal recessive well that means that both mom and dad need to pass on to you a mutated copy of the gene and there's one other thing I should mention so so when we say that a gene mutation causes a disease so in this case we say a gene mutation causes Parkinson's disease we can either mean that it definitely causes the disease 100% so if you get the mutated copy or if it needs two copies of the gene you will definitely develop the disease or we can mean that getting the mutated copy or copies will increase your chance of developing the disease so those two things are a little different right and for some genes certain mutations within that gene will definitely cause the disease and other mutations in that gene may just increase the chance of a disease developing and that's because different mutations in Jeane affect the genes protein in different ways right so some mutations may be more detrimental than others so that can increase the chance of disease developing so as we're chatting about these these mutated genes that we're going to get to that are relevant to Parkinson's disease we're just going to say that they can cause the disease but in the back of our minds we just have to remember that depending on which specific mutation in the gene is happening because there can be quite a few different ones in one gene and this is still being researched right the mutation can either 100% cause the disease or just increase the chances of developing the disease okay so there are five main genes that we know about so there are a few more but there's five main ones that when they're mutated in some way can cause Parkinson's disease so we won't go into all of these genes but let's go over a few of the genes that are a bit more commonly mutated so let's head over here to our first chromosome chromosome number one so here's our first chromosome so it's just it's just hanging out here and and right about here we have a gene called Park seven and park seven it has instructions for making a protein called DJ one so here's DJ one here and and DJ one kind of makes me think of a mom when I think about what DJ one does I think if I think of a mom it does things like protecting and guiding right protecting and guiding our molecules around our body you know like how your mom protects and guides you right so it helps protect ourselves it helps protect them during situations that stress ourselves out and and it helps guide our proteins so it helps guide them to do things like make sure they're folding in the correct three-dimensional shape because remember that our proteins are proteins need to get into a certain shape in order to be able to function properly right and dj1 also helps to make sure that damaged proteins proteins that we we don't want anymore are sent off to be broken down because otherwise they kind of pile up in our cells and they get in the way right now this last ones not very mom-like I'm sure none of our moms would send us off to be degraded but anyway so those are some of the main tasks of dj1 so some mutations in the gene park7 can cause Parkinson's disease park7 is one of those genes where you need to get a mutated copy from both your mom and your dad in order to develop Parkinson's disease so this would be considered an autosomal recessive cause of Parkinson's disease and it's actually responsible for early onset Parkinson's disease so so Parkinson's that's diagnosed before the age of 50 years old so when park7 is mutated when the genes DNA is changed in some way that changes the instructions on how to make the dj1 protein right because the gene carries our recipe for that protein so when this has changed dj1 isn't made properly and therefore it can't function properly it can't do all of these important mom-like tasks that we talked about so that's park7 and dj1 so what's our next gene let's let's jump over here to chromosome 6 and let's check out our next gene so about about here on chromosome 6 about here this is this is where our Park 2 gene is and for a mutation in this gene to cause Parkinson's disease it would need to be inherited in an autosomal recessive way as well a mutated copy from both your mom and your dad oh and something that's really interesting is that the park 2 gene it's one of the largest genes that we humans have in our whole body so it's one of the biggest genes that we have so park2 it encodes for a protein called Parkin so let's draw let's draw a little Park in protein here and Parkin has this really really important role what it does is it tags other proteins that are damaged or or that we have too many of there they're in excess and it tags them with this molecule called ubiquitin so ubiquitin is like a it's like a little flag it's a flag that alerts ourselves to shuttle these proteins that we don't want that we don't want anymore and it alerts them to shuttle them to these structures in our cells called proteasome and this is where those proteins that we don't want get broken down and disposed of so proteasomes are kind of like the the waste disposal facility in our cells so parking is really really important from making sure that we don't have all these excess or damaged proteins kind of piling up in ourselves and getting in the way so we actually know of a couple 100 different Park two mutations that can cause parkinson's disease so some of these mutations are associated with the juvenile form of Parkinson's disease which is essentially an extremely early onset type of Parkinson's disease relatively speaking to when it normally comes on so when people are diagnosed before the age of 20 and some other park2 mutations they're associated with late onset Parkinson's disease which is when people are diagnosed after the age of 50 years old but in either case whether it's early or late Parkinson's disease these mutations have changed the gene a bit right they've changed our instructions for making Parkin and so we end up with a non-functional Parkin protein a Parkin protein that just can't do what it needs to do it can't function properly it can't tag these damaged proteins so that we get rid of them so our last gene that we're going to look at is is over here on chromosome 12 so here's chromosome 12 here I'll just draw it out and the gene that we're interested in is the LR rk2 gene so I'm going to call it lark - it's just a little easier to say and and it sits about here so so lark - gives us the recipe to make the protein dard erin and dart erin helps us do things like turn our cells on and off so that we can control their activity and and send signals around the brain so that different cells can talk to each other and what's really interesting is lark - mutations are actually the most common gene mutation that is associated with Parkinson's disease so this is the gene that we normally see issues with in people that have a genetic form of the disease and with this particular gene people only need to get one mutated copy from either of their parents rather than both so this is an autosomal dominant genetic cause of Parkinson's disease and just like before when when our lark - gene gets mutated we end up with a malformed a damaged dard erin protein being formed right so it's being produced by transcription and translation but because we've damaged the lark - gene in some way the instructions are all wrong so the protein ends up being formed a little differently so it can't function properly in order to carry out its really important roles so we've gone through some of these gene mutations that can as Parkinson's disease but by now you must be wondering yeah I get that I get that Park seven and park two and lark two can get mutated and produce malformed proteins and then they can't do their jobs correctly etc etc but what does that have to do with Parkinson's disease how does that cause Parkinson's disease and that's an excellent question and and the answer as it stands right now is that we actually don't know we don't know how these genes getting mutated and these proteins being malformed we don't know how that actually leads to the disease we just know that we consistently see Parkinson's disease development in people with these gene mutations but we don't yet know kind of step by step how people with these mutations actually develop Parkinson's disease so for now we'll just have to stay tuned into the ongoing research efforts to find out more about this one Putting it all together - Pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease

Step Four: Combine the Oil Mixture and Water Mixture Together I know, oil and water don’t mix—except when they do, thanks to a blender!  Scoop the oil mixture into the basin of a blender.  Make sure to really scrape out as much of the mixture as you can.  Place the lid on the blender and then turn it on medium-high.  Slowly stream in the water mixture a little at a time as the blender runs.  The mixture will continue to thicken with the more water you add (I know, it’s counterintuitive).  Once all the water is added, the mixture should be thick enough that the blender struggles to blend it.  That’s when you know it’s ready.  Turn off the blender and voila, you have lotion!  Depending on the power of your blender, the mixture may have heated up during the emulsion process—which is no big deal, it just means that the mixture will thicken even more as it cools back down to room temperature.  Step Five: Store, Label, and Use Scoop your DIY lotion out of the blender and keep in airtight small jars.

Planning also involves a decision concerning your target-marketing base.  It answers the question: Who will buy your new fragrance?  This concerns researching consumer trends in order to ascertain which demographics your fragrance will appeal to and in what product form.  For example, some consumers from older age groups might prefer sustainable simple scents with essential oils and natural bases, while a younger clientele might lean more towards celebrity-endorsed fragrances.  Research Clientele And Target Consumer Base A target market can be tricky to ascertain.  For example, the majority of men do not buy their own fragrances, and if they do, they mostly select one favored by their significant others.

You can even get lotion that heats up during application to add sensory warmth to the parts of your body to which it is applied.  The feel of gentle softness on your skin rotating in firm, steady massage movements can remove stress, subdue pain, and enhance endorphins to make you feel great.

Written by Grace Young in Scented Candles Having candles in the home is one of the best ways to liven up the atmosphere, create a cozy mood, and even add some scent.  But from unscented candles to candles that simply don’t smell of much, you sometimes feel like you have to add your own touch.  With that in mind, you may have thought of adding essential oils to your burning candles to make them smell stronger.  But is it a good idea, and will it work?  Let’s find out!  Adding pure essential oils to the pool of melted wax in a burning candle is safe, and a good way to create a stronger smell.  The essential oils will mix in with the wax and burn at the correct temperature, which will release a strong smell throughout the room.  But be careful, essential oils are flammable.  As an alternative, you could also put a couple of drops of candle fragrance oil into your candle, or even specks of scented wax cubes.

Some ingredients to look for include carrier oils and essential oils.  Carrier oils, which come from seeds and nuts, moisturize the skin among other attributes.  Carrier oils include coconut oil, jojoba oil, and almond oil.  Essential oils, such as sandalwood, pine, and cedarwood, typically provide a lotion with its scent (usually subtle) while offering other benefits for skin health.  Shea butter and cocoa butter have moisturizing qualities and help to soften skin.  Fatty alcohols, meanwhile, stabilize a lotion’s ingredients while also acting as an emollient, i.e., skin softener.  Some ingredients to avoid include synthetic colors and fragrances.  They often contain ingredients that can cause skin irritation, particularly for men with sensitive skin.  Short-chain alcohols –sometimes referred to as “simple” alcohol – can irritate and even damage the skin.  Be wary of chemical names such as isopropyl, ethanol, and propanol, among many others.  Parabens, often found in mass-produced hand creams and lotions, act as a preservative but are linked to a variety of health problems, although there’s no definitive proof yet.  2",What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?,train,"[[0.9089667797088623, 0.0910332202911377], [0.31576186418533325, 0.6842381358146667], [0.6734326481819153, 0.32656732201576233], [0.31769129633903503, 0.6823087334632874], [0.20537151396274567, 0.7946284413337708], [0.8246818780899048, 0.17531810700893402], [0.8685112595558167, 0.13148880004882812], [0.6958344578742981, 0.3041655719280243], [0.9702506065368652, 0.029749419540166855], [0.9595187306404114, 0.04048128053545952], [0.6508551836013794, 0.349144846200943], [0.7824729681015015, 0.21752698719501495], [0.9599308371543884, 0.04006916284561157]]","[[1.2713960409164429, -1.0296881198883057], [-0.2083461880683899, 0.5649715065956116], [0.4857276976108551, -0.23802421987056732], [-0.23484015464782715, 0.5295619368553162], [-0.4967677891254425, 0.8562862277030945], [0.9517796039581299, -0.5966159701347351], [1.0735112428665161, -0.8143476247787476], [0.5507447123527527, -0.2767949104309082], [1.8688445091247559, -1.6159002780914307], [1.7160712480545044, -1.4495209455490112], [0.4417186379432678, -0.1810816526412964], [0.8195264935493469, -0.46060994267463684], [1.7205684185028076, -1.4556857347488403]]",0.7946284413337708,0.29744000217089284

Stick with a few scents from the same scent family such as florals or fruit.  Decide which essential oils will be your base note, middle note and top note.  The base note is the scent that is noticeable the longest after it has been on your skin.  The middle note also stays for an extended amount of time but not as long as the base note.  The high note is generally the most identifiable scent when you first apply it to your skin.  Making the Fragrance Add the base note oil to the measuring cup with the dropper.  Add the middle note oil to the measuring cup with a dropper.  Add the high note oil to the measuring cup.  If making perfume oil, these essential oils should only make up 10 percent of your overall mixture.  Add the carrier oil to make up the rest of the equated amount.  In perfume oil, the carrier oil will be 90 percent of the mixture.  Mix well with a clean spoon and pour into a dark colored-glass bottle with a tight seal to preserve the oils.  Tips You only need a few dabs on your skin at a time, since the essential oils are so strong.","Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?",train,"[[0.4046536684036255, 0.5953463315963745], [0.7161371111869812, 0.2838628888130188], [0.735028088092804, 0.26497191190719604], [0.9682585000991821, 0.03174147009849548], [0.9514846205711365, 0.04851536825299263], [0.9668575525283813, 0.033142395317554474], [0.4830101430416107, 0.5169898271560669], [0.2600476145744324, 0.7399523854255676], [0.3338838815689087, 0.6661161184310913], [0.7984182238578796, 0.20158182084560394], [0.3673901855945587, 0.6326098442077637], [0.9064249992370605, 0.09357495605945587], [0.3143087327480316, 0.6856912970542908], [0.7779185175895691, 0.22208146750926971]]","[[-0.004951712675392628, 0.3811599910259247], [0.6602118015289307, -0.26516854763031006], [0.7320144772529602, -0.2882704436779022], [1.851261019706726, -1.566614031791687], [1.6336536407470703, -1.3424893617630005], [1.8302074670791626, -1.5430303812026978], [0.12629330158233643, 0.19427886605262756], [-0.24008162319660187, 0.805639386177063], [-0.09163694083690643, 0.599033772945404], [0.8819238543510437, -0.49451330304145813], [-0.05527082458138466, 0.48815855383872986], [1.25521719455719, -1.0155283212661743], [-0.12931035459041595, 0.6507413983345032], [0.8396205902099609, -0.41395682096481323]]",0.7399523854255676,0.3582984344767673

They’re concentrated plant and flower extracts and come in a fairly extensive range.  The downside of using essential oils is their expense and propensity for fading with time.  It’s especially problematic for citrus essential oils such as lemon and orange.  To learn more about what percentages of essential oils to use in your recipes visit this page.  Handmade soap naturally colored with cochineal Fragrance oils Fragrance oils are commercially produced perfumes for the toiletry and home industry.  They’re relatively inexpensive, have a scent that lasts ages, and have a much more varied range to choose from.  If you like baby powder scented soap or a shampoo that smells like coconut then you’ll need to use fragrance oils.  Keep in mind that fragrance oils are both synthetic and patent-protected products though.  That means that you’ll never truly know all the ingredients used to make them and that they are definitely not natural.  In many cases, they can contain petrochemicals and allergens that cause people to sneeze or have skin reactions.  Another thing to be aware of is that not all fragrance oils are skin-safe.  Many made for the candle and diffuser industry can cause rashes and burns if used on the skin.","Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?",train,"[[0.7748038172721863, 0.2251962125301361], [0.9208586812019348, 0.07914139330387115], [0.9298709034919739, 0.07012908160686493], [0.9168715476989746, 0.08312852680683136], [0.9524483680725098, 0.04755164310336113], [0.9489153623580933, 0.05108465626835823], [0.884044885635376, 0.1159551814198494], [0.7622511386871338, 0.2377488911151886], [0.9182738661766052, 0.08172614127397537], [0.9040927886962891, 0.09590721875429153], [0.9531094431877136, 0.046890582889318466], [0.9520754218101501, 0.04792458564043045], [0.9487305283546448, 0.05126950889825821]]","[[0.8529602885246277, -0.38267749547958374], [1.374355435371399, -1.0797150135040283], [1.4255608320236206, -1.1591473817825317], [1.3343223333358765, -1.066257119178772], [1.6507600545883179, -1.3464595079421997], [1.597306489944458, -1.3245289325714111], [1.170371413230896, -0.8609327673912048], [0.7989481687545776, -0.36611276865005493], [1.35884690284729, -1.0602747201919556], [1.275558590888977, -0.9679920673370361], [1.6476134061813354, -1.3642994165420532], [1.63530695438385, -1.3537085056304932], [1.6087018251419067, -1.3093267679214478]]",0.2377488911151886,0.09489643258544114

The problem with linalool is, that just like limonene it oxidises on air exposure and becomes allergenic.

By Luke O'Neil Jan 17, 2018 Getty Images There are pieces of my body missing.  Well, technically they’re still there, but I can’t see or feel them anymore.  Anyone who’s taken months off from the gym or spent time in recovery from an injury, particularly after years of exercising, can relate.  Your legs feel weaker, muscles on your shoulders have seemingly vanished, and your abdominals have retreated behind an expanding layer of fat.  To use a medical term, it sucks.

In general, the longer you have been training, the more quickly you’ll be able to get back into it after a layoff, she says.

In addition, knowing the signs of heat injury and being able to treat it immediately will reduce the number of severe cases.  Cause When we exercise, our bodies cool off by sweating.  As we perspire, we lose necessary body fluids.  If we do not replace these fluids, we become dehydrated.  This makes it difficult to sweat and cool down, which can result in a heat injury.

April 9, 2018 | In Blog, Running | By Emily Trinh What type of running training do you do when you say, “you’re going for a run?”  Most people tend to stick to their usual route, pace, and distance.  However, this means that you are missing out on different types of running exercises that you can do that will mix things up while giving you great benefits.  So, here we run (pun intended) you through some alternate running exercises that you can try.  Try these different types of running workouts! 1.  Base Run In a base run, you run at your natural pace to build up aerobic capacity.  Base runs are what usually makes up the brunt of your running training and because it shouldn’t be too challenging, they can be done quite often.  2.  Progression Run A bit more difficult than the base run, this type of training means that you run at your natural pace but finish it at a faster rate.  So you gradually become faster as you keep going.  This is a moderately-challenging workout that will help improve your running stamina.",Cool.

Here are some tips to climb back on that treadmill after you’ve fallen off.  Don’t Break the Habit – The easiest way to keep things going is simply not to stop.  Avoid long breaks in exercising or rebuilding the habit will take some effort.  This may be advice a little too late for some people.  But if you have an exercise habit going, don’t drop it at the first sign of trouble.  Reward Showing Up – Woody Allen once said that, “Half of life is showing up.”  I’d argue that 90% of making a habit is just making the effort to get there.  You can worry about your weight, amount of laps you run or the amount you can bench press later.  Commit for Thirty Days – Make a commitment to go every day (even just for 20 minutes) for one month.  This will solidify the exercise habit.  By making a commitment you also take pressure off yourself in the first weeks back of deciding whether to go.  Make it Fun – If you don’t enjoy yourself at the gym, it is going to be hard to keep it a habit.",Cool.

Good training and socialization can help prevent aggressive behaviors.  As for the exercise requirements of this breed, 1-2 walks a day of moderate length is usually enough for Pugsunds.  However, there are some things to keep in mind to ensure their safety during exercise.  Special Care Dogs of the Pug Dachshund Mix may inherit structural health issues from their parents, which we will detail further in the next section.  But these health problems may require special care when exercising your Pug Dachshund Mix.  If your Pugsund has the flat face of the Pug, never take them outside in hot weather.  The flat-face leads to problems cooling themselves, so they can be very prone to overheating.  On days such as these, it is better to exercise them indoors.  If the shortened legs of the Dachshund are present, it is imperative that you look after their joints and back.  They are prone to injury, and constant wear and tear can lead to serious health problems.  To keep them safe, do not allow them to run up or down stairs or other steep terrains.  It is also a good idea to prevent them from jumping on and off furniture or other objects.",Cool.

But supplementing running with strength training will not only help you prevent injury, but it will also make you a stronger, faster, and more efficient runner.  That said, strength training for runners is different than it is for your standard gym rat.

You can buy a small set of light free weights for lifting at home and choose exercises that use your own body weight as resistance to build strength.  If you have severe COPD symptoms or limited energy, there are a variety of chair exercises you can do that are designed specifically for people with limited strength and mobility.  Most doctors recommend doing strength training sessions at least three days a week in order to see an improvement in strength and muscle mass.  You should start slow, doing only as much as you can handle without feeling too breathless or fatigued.  You can add in extra muscle groups and repetitions as time goes on and your strength and endurance increases.  Just make sure you talk to your doctor before starting any new exercise routine, and don't be afraid to ask for advice, either.",What strength exercises do you recommend to mix with running?,train,"[[0.9357860684394836, 0.06421392410993576], [0.8478663563728333, 0.15213365852832794], [0.8999494314193726, 0.10005053877830505], [0.7894867658615112, 0.21051323413848877], [0.8939234614372253, 0.10607656091451645], [0.9280493855476379, 0.07195062935352325], [0.6717313528060913, 0.3282686769962311], [0.8735038042068481, 0.12649621069431305], [0.8445138335227966, 0.15548625588417053]]","[[1.4672167301177979, -1.2119501829147339], [1.0090835094451904, -0.7088800668716431], [1.239471673965454, -0.9571914672851562], [0.8720802068710327, -0.44975441694259644], [1.2023297548294067, -0.9291293025016785], [1.4054707288742065, -1.1516340970993042], [0.47503602504730225, -0.24099010229110718], [1.1224323511123657, -0.8098676800727844], [1.0396047830581665, -0.6525990962982178]]",0.3282686769962311,0.146132187710868

Work out on your pectoral muscles, if you want a fuller look to your breasts.  What can you do to enhance some of these effects?  Running increases the lean muscle up to a certain point.  Increased running will not increase your lean muscle beyond this point.  Therefore running should be combined with weight training to achieve the desirable level of muscle/ fat ratio and gain the shapely toned body you always dreamed of.  What is weight training or strength training?  Weight training is physical training which involves lifting weights.  This will help you gain a certain amount of muscle mass while reducing body fat.  According to American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), exercisers aiming to improve strength and power should perform exercises for 8-12 repetitions.  If you wish to improve muscular endurance, perform 10 -15 reps of each exercise using a lighter weight.  It is important to rest for 2-3 minutes in between weight lifting.

A weak core leads to compensatory movements, thus decreasing your forward propulsion.  A strong upper body is essential for guaranteeing an efficient transfer of energy from your body to your legs.  Without this, the proper arm technique cannot provide optimal support to your legs.  An efficient running form helps you run faster and expend less energy.  An additional benefit: well-developed abs and back muscles help protect your spine from the impact of running.  Thus, a strong core is essential for minimizing the risk of injury.  Upper body exercises for runners: Here is a list of exercises you can do to build upper body strength at home, without weights: Bodyweight biceps exercises and triceps exercises Core exercises for runners Dynamic plank variations Back exercises you can do at home Good to know: The best exercises for building up your stabilizing muscles (pelvic, abdominal, and back muscles) are complex total body exercises like Planks, Push-ups, and Burpees.

How Do You Make It Easier?  “Starting with a reverse lunge is easier to learn and execute, but still offers the same benefits of the forward lunge,” McClendon says.  Start by standing tall with both feet facing forward.  Take a big step back onto the ball of your right foot—keep the heel off the ground.  Bend both knees until the left thigh is parallel to the ground and the right knee is hovering just above the ground, legs forming 90-degree angles.  Push through the left heel to return to standing.  When you’re ready, add resistance by holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.  If you’re working out at home, you use a towel as shown to make the move more challenging.  What are the benefits of lunges?  Lunges help runners control the hips and strengthen the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and core—all muscle groups we rely on to run).  They also help identify weaknesses that can lead to running injuries, says McClendon.

Simply remember to maintain a healthy, balanced diet, and not any fad diet that you may find.  1.  Eat Healthy and Regularly Consider what you can add to your regular diet rather than what you must not consume when you wish to lose weight.  Ideally, consume a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains and pulses.  Most dietitians recommend that you do not skip any meals.  Ensure that you control your meal portions and that you receive all the nutrients you need from the food you eat.  If you wish to lose weight in a goal-oriented manner, make sure to cut back on carbohydrates, salt, butter, sugar, and fried foods.

When you are beginning a workout plan with the goal to lose weight most professionals recommend a slightly different plan than the one previously discussed.  In order to lose weight, your caloric output must be greater than your caloric intake.  Dieting is one way to reduce caloric intake; however, dieting and nutrition alone will not produce the effect of both weight loss and toned muscles.  When you diet alone you lose weight from both fat and muscle.  Reducing muscle size decreases metabolism which makes it harder to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight over the long term.  Therefore, you must always incorporate exercise into any weight loss plan.  When you wish to lose weight most doctors recommend at least 30 minutes a day of some form of cardio exercise five times per week or more.  This can be combined with a weight training regimen similar to the two times per week per muscle group routine discussed above.  When you combine weight training with cardio you increase muscle mass, which in turn, increases metabolism and helps you shed the pounds more quickly.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines safe weight loss as 1 to 2 lb.  per week.  This is the ideal rate of weight loss you should average per week to allow your body ample time to adjust to the changes and to help you stick to your weight loss plan over the long term.  Exercise Weight Loss Average Certified personal trainer Christian Finn says exercise alone will not produce significant weight loss results.  He refers to several university studies on exercise versus weight loss, and in each case, the weight loss results were far below the CDC’s recommended average of 1 to 2 lb.  per week; many showed results of less than 0.5 lb.  per week.  The type of exercise used in most of these studies was moderate aerobic activities, such as jogging or biking, up to four times weekly.

If you want to lose more weight, add some hills or a few walking intervals to boost intensity and burn more calories.  You can also schedule more than one walking workout per day since the activity isn't too strenuous.  And if you love to run, then keep pounding the pavement as long as your joints remain healthy.  Hills are a great option for runners, as are speed intervals.  4 Add some cross-training (like strength workouts, swimming, boot camp-style workouts, or cycling) to stay motivated and give your body a break from the miles you log on the road.  You can even throw a few walking workouts into your running routine to boost hip health and work your glutes.  In the walking vs. running debate, both workouts win.  Either way, you'll burn calories, build strength, decrease stress, and do good for your body.  Was this page helpful?  Thanks for your feedback!  Looking to lose weight?

Restarting a device is always an ultimate solution for any issue.  Not only Galaxy but this applies to each and every electronic device.  I used to tell my mom to restart her device if she faces any issue with her smartphone.  Well if you still need to know how to restart then, here is it: Press your phone’s power button.  On the screen, tap Restart.  The other way of the reboot is as follows: Press and hold the Volume Down button.  While holding it down, press and hold the Power key.  Keep the button held for 10 seconds, it will be restarted automatically.  If this doesn’t work then head to the next method.

In this procedure, a stapling method is used to create a small pouch in the stomach, which can only hold a small amount of food.  The newly formed pouch is then attached to the small intestine, allowing food to bypass part of the small intestine, which is where most of the calorie absorption takes place.  Adjustable gastric band This procedure helps you achieve lasting results by limiting food intake, reducing appetite and slowing digestion.  Like a wristwatch, an inflatable silicone band is wrapped around the upper stomach to create a new, tiny pouch.  This stomach pouch limits and controls the amount of food you eat.  A small outlet is also created to slow the emptying process into the stomach and intestines.  As a result, you should feel full and be satisfied with smaller amounts of food, which leads to weight loss.

DIY If you don't have the extra cash to burn every month and quality food is important, the cheaper solution is to try controlling your calorie intake and to exercise plenty, Goulda Downer, Ph.D., a registered dietician who heads Metroplex Health and Nutrition Services in Washington, D.C. wrote in an e-mail for a story we published last year.  'If you follow the 1200-1500 calorie diet stipulated by NutriSystem most people may lose some weight,' Downer wrote.  'However, the average individual eating the same amount of calories, without the high cost could achieve the same results.  While NutriSystem prepackaged meals is a convenience for some there are better and healthier alternatives to weight loss.'  The problem, one dietician on Health.com warned, is that once a person gets off the NutriSystem diet, he or she may quickly put the weight back on.

However, if you have decided to reduce body weight, then you have been little extra concerned about what will burn off the most calories and how.  Here are some early morning exercises for weight loss- #1.  Cardio: Cardio exercises are one of the most significant when you are willing to decrease your body weight.  The basic thing to lose weight is burning calories, okay?  It is a reality that working cardio in the beginning of the morning, on a vacant stomach, supports your muscles to oxidize the enhanced fatty acids in the body.  Simple to understand, you may burn the stored fat outside the body and not the calories that you have just consumed.  #2. Run or Walk: In the gym or home, people use to walk on the treadmill.  However, rather than this try going outside as the fresh air, without pollution makes your lungs, heart and mind healthy.  Furthermore, going outside for early morning exercise either running or walk would relate you to nature.  #3.

Sleeping doesn't burn fat on its own, but it is a crucial part of weight loss efforts.  This is mainly because sleep deprivation (not getting enough sleep) makes most aspects of weight loss more difficult.  When you aren't well-rested, it's hard to motivate yourself to get up and move.  It's also hard to control cravings: you're more likely to act on impulses to eat junk food when you're already drained of energy.

So, when taken together, you can see how this can easily make up a large volume of training.  Why is low-intensity training important for developing your LT?  First, by keeping most of your training volume at lower intensities, this allows for a much larger training volume.  Second, a large volume of low intensity training is vital for the development of a well-conditioned and efficient aerobic system.  In particular, this leads to specific adaptations within your slow twitch muscle fibres.  These adaptations include: Increased mitochondrial size, density and activity Greater muscle capillarisation Increased aerobic enzyme levels and activity Greater aerobic energy production Enhanced fat oxidation So, now let’s look at HITT training.  2  . High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) High-intensity interval training (HIIT training) refers to training that’s completed at intensities that are close to, or above your VO2 max (maximal aerobic capacity).  To be high intensity, this should be above 90% of VO2max – normally this would involve completing intervals at an intensity of around 95-100% of VO2max.

An additional benefit of weight-bearing exercise is maintaining bone mass and preventing osteoporosis.  However, with cycling and recumbent cycling, there is much less trauma to the muscles and joints, heart rate is generally lower, and thus longer exercise bouts are possible.

For more serious endurance athletes who train at or above the VT, carbohydrate ingestion can be a key nutritional strategy to increase exercise performance.  Serious endurance athletes who train at these higher intensity can often benefit from replenishing muscle glycogen stores regularly during training blocks of higher volumes and frequency of sessions at higher intensities (% of VO2 max).  Bodybuilders Assuming beginner and intermediate bodybuilders are consuming adequate amounts of calories; muscle glycogen depletion is often not a high concern.  Availability of carbohydrates, which are the primary fuel for forceful muscle contractions, can be accomplished by consuming a diet that supplies enough calories to fuel training and recovery.  Competitive bodybuilders more prone to dieting and who train with higher intensities and volumes, may find that their recovery can be supported by emphasizing the importance of pre, intra, and post-training nutrition strategies to optimize carbohydrate ingestion/replenishment.

It's not uncommon for your hunger to spike later in the day or even the next day.  Runger Pangs How do you recognize actual hunger from what you think is hunger and learn when you should or shouldn't eat more?  We called in the experts for their tips to help you manage your runger, once and for all.  1.  Assess your effort.  If you're running less than an hour per day, there's no need to increase your daily intake, says Taylor.  However, you do need to be sure that you are refueling properly post-workout.  'The biggest mistake athletes make is under-fueling [  after a run],' she says.  While this is sometimes done intentionally to lose weight, always consult with a pro before running on empty (aka fasted cardio) or skipping post-run nutrition, particularly after a more demanding run.  2  . Fuel for thought.  When that ravenous hunger does kick in, our bodies don't always register immediately that we're full.

If you're undertaking a strenuous exercise routine, there are several strategies endurance athletes use to avoid decreased performance you may find helpful: Carbo-loading: Some athletes eat excessive amounts of carbohydrates before an endurance event.  While extra carbs will provide ample fuel, the method has largely fallen out of favor as it can also lead to excess water weight and digestive issues.  Consuming glucose gels: Energy gels containing glycogen can be consumed in advance of or as-needed during an endurance event to increase blood glucose levels.  Eating a low-carb ketogenic diet: Eating a diet high in fat and low in carbs can put your body in a keto-adaptative state.  In this state, your body begins to access stored fat for energy and relies less on glucose as a fuel source.  Pros and Cons of the Ketogenic Diet Was this page helpful?  Thanks for your feedback!

When you run for longer than 60 minutes, stored muscle glycogen gets depleted.  2 ﻿ When stored glycogen stores are low, then the sugar in your blood and liver glycogen become more important.  1 ﻿ Fueling with carbohydrate foods and beverages during your longer runs will prevent you from running out of energy and help boost your performance.  Refueling during your long runs helps to replace essential glucose that is burned as fuel.  Many experts advise refueling with some form of carbohydrate during high endurance runs lasting longer than 60 minutes.  2 ﻿ How Much to Eat How much you should eat when running is also determined by a few different factors.  Your body size, the intensity of your run, and its duration affect how much you need to eat.  A basic rule of thumb is that you should be taking in about 100 calories after about an hour of running and then another 100 calories every 40 to 45 minutes after that.",So is it best to avoid running on an empty stomach as a leisure athlete?,train,"[[0.3026778995990753, 0.6973221302032471], [0.7815217971801758, 0.2184782326221466], [0.6208588480949402, 0.3791411817073822], [0.76458740234375, 0.23541255295276642], [0.3069285452365875, 0.6930714249610901], [0.495272696018219, 0.5047273635864258], [0.7680758237838745, 0.2319241464138031], [0.36240994930267334, 0.6375900506973267], [0.5173587203025818, 0.482641339302063], [0.4862414300441742, 0.5137585401535034]]","[[-0.23035919666290283, 0.6042190790176392], [0.8399850726127625, -0.4345715641975403], [0.34106722474098206, -0.15212790668010712], [0.7922278642654419, -0.3857690691947937], [-0.19693470001220703, 0.6175833940505981], [0.10889928042888641, 0.12780921161174774], [0.803008496761322, -0.394469678401947], [-0.11001978069543839, 0.4548996686935425], [0.150328129529953, 0.08086548000574112], [0.10711424797773361, 0.16216231882572174]]",0.6973221302032471,0.45940669625997543

One of the ways you can do this is by seeking out new terrain.  If you've been running to lose weight along the same flat path each day, find some hills and get your legs pumping.  Running uphill can dramatically increase your calorie burn.  Try doing hill repeats by running to the top of a hill, walking back down and running up the hill again.  This will build strength in your legs and further challenge your cardio fitness.  High-intensity interval training, or HIIT, is another way to increase the intensity and variety of your running routine.  Interval training involves alternating between periods of intense effort and periods of recovery.  There are many ways to do an interval workout, but one example you might try is jogging for two minutes, sprinting for 45 seconds and alternate between the two for 30 minutes.  This might take some practice, but it will result in a higher total calorie burn.  There's scientific support for the efficacy of HIIT for weight loss.

This is the rate at which your body burns calories while at rest.  When you do cardio, your body does burn calories quickly during the exercise, but this rate drops once you are done.  On the other hand, strength training keeps your metabolic rate high long after you have left the gym.  Some secrets to weight lifting while trying to get lean include (7): 1.  Do more compound exercises.  They work out more muscle groups in a single move, thus burning more calories and building stronger muscles.  Great examples of such exercises include barbell deadlifts, squats, dumbbell bench press, dumbbell walking lunges, kettlebell squats press, and pullups.  2  .  Keep your heart rate up.  This is better achieved when you take short breaks during your workouts.  Instead of taking a 2-minute break between sets, reduce this time to 30 to 45 seconds.

You reach your maximum heart rate while you do cross-country skiing.  Therefore, it is a great cardio workout.  For those who prefer going a bit less intense, they can control their cardio workout by going a little slower in the tracks.  It is all up to you – but no doubt outdoor workout during the winter (like skiing) is a lot better than your indoor gym.  Aerobic and Anaerobic Workout Skiing is a great aerobic as well as anaerobic sport as skiers use their momentum and bodyweight to ski.  The aerobic threshold is a relatively steady state of workout that you can perform for a longer duration of time without going out of breath.  Cross-country skiing lets you increase your aerobic threshold so that you can go for a longer duration.  The anaerobic threshold, on the other hand, is the point when your body switches from its aerobic metabolism to anaerobic one.  It is a great measure in endurance sports when you need to decide the intensity of your workout.  During intense skiing when your body cannot keep up with its energy demands, the anaerobic state kicks in.",I don’t have an indoor bike and neither am I great at skiing.

What Burns More Calories Walking or Biking: FAQ Is walking or riding a bike better for losing weight?  According to their type, walking and running bicycles in nature, both are a different “form of exercise.”  Here you understand both terms and will acknowledge what burns more calories walking or biking.  Walking and biking are the best options for exercise as both help circulate and pump your blood flow.  On the other hand, the more walking intensity can make a more difference than cycling, reducing “pounds” of weight.  If you are walking over a super brisk wall at a “moderate pace” of 4mph, it’s more likely to reduce 350 calories per hour.  Instead of walking, if you are into a race running position, then approximately 500-600 “calories burns.”",I don’t have an indoor bike and neither am I great at skiing.

It is much more practical to use this number than the flight of stairs as the number of stairs in different flights may vary greatly.  On average, climbing a flight of 13 stairs takes about 8 seconds.  8 seconds = 8/60 of a minute = 0.13 minutes = 0.13/60 of an hour = 0.002222 hours.  Finally, you can calculate the answer: Calories burned = METS (4) x Weight (77kg) x Time (.00222 hours)= 0.68 calories.  So, you spend between 0.5 and one calorie while climbing one flight of stairs.  Doesn’t look a lot, but that’s just 8 seconds.  And it’s 4 times more than what you’d have burned by just sitting on your sofa scrolling through social media.  Shutterstock Does Running Stairs Help Burn Calories?  Burning more calories running rather than walking up the stairs should not come as a surprise.  Here’s a list outlining the number of calories burned running a flight of stairs, as well as some other similar activities (5): You burn 5 calories per minute by walking slowly upstairs.

Do squats during commercial breaks while watching television.  Have a sit-up competition.  Buy a pedometer for each member of the family, and have a daily challenge to see who can take the most steps.  Visit the zoo, museum, or amusement park to get in plenty of walking.  Have a hula hoop contest.  Jump rope.  Make a pact that for every 10 minutes on the computer everyone has to run up and down the stairs 10 times.  Volunteer to walk the dogs at your local SPCA.  Go on a scavenger hunt.  Have a bike race around the block.  Choose gifts that make your child move such as balls, bicycles, skates, or kites.  Present a weekly fitness challenge for the whole family, and post it on the fridge.  Some examples include performing 10 jumping jacks every day, doing 10 squats every time you go to sit down, or jumping on one leg for as long as you can.  Keep a box in the trunk of your car that holds balls, jump ropes, and chalk.  That way you will be ready for an afternoon of fitness fun, whenever, and wherever you are.","I suppose I could do jumping rope or kickboxing, but I like the outdoors and would like to work out there.",train,"[[0.878796398639679, 0.12120361626148224], [0.8478867411613464, 0.15211333334445953], [0.9417110085487366, 0.05828896164894104], [0.8795562982559204, 0.12044373154640198], [0.906883180141449, 0.09311677515506744], [0.9144571423530579, 0.08554280549287796], [0.8625850081443787, 0.13741497695446014], [0.8436009883880615, 0.1563989520072937], [0.9233207106590271, 0.07667925953865051], [0.914806604385376, 0.08519343286752701], [0.9415978789329529, 0.058402083814144135], [0.8802425861358643, 0.11975743621587753], [0.8707465529441833, 0.12925337255001068], [0.9213353395462036, 0.078664630651474], [0.7444286346435547, 0.2555713951587677], [0.8458290100097656, 0.15417100489139557], [0.9025611281394958, 0.09743891656398773]]","[[1.121691346168518, -0.8593900203704834], [1.0069280862808228, -0.7111931443214417], [1.5158122777938843, -1.266473412513733], [1.1173852682113647, -0.870849609375], [1.254093050956726, -1.022066354751587], [1.3376989364624023, -1.0316146612167358], [1.0576244592666626, -0.7793038487434387], [0.9754477739334106, -0.7098217010498047], [1.3683182001113892, -1.1200271844863892], [1.3095934391021729, -1.0641950368881226], [1.5134607553482056, -1.266765832901001], [1.1323801279067993, -0.8623490333557129], [1.0785678625106812, -0.8290084004402161], [1.3465605974197388, -1.1140698194503784], [0.7388248443603516, -0.3302903175354004], [0.9954040050506592, -0.7068507671356201], [1.230421781539917, -0.9955889582633972]]",0.2555713951587677,0.11645027556840111

Resistance training can help you tone up your chest and belly.  However, if you have some fat covering the muscle you need cardio too.  Push-ups and crunches will not spot reduce the fat that covers these areas, but combining a sound exercise plan with a healthy diet will.  Plan and Execute Set a schedule and stick to it if you want to tone your chest and belly.  Do cardio three to five days per week for at least 30 minutes.  Train at a moderate to high intensity with activities such as swimming, biking, running or even jump rope.  Train your chest and abs two or three times per week on nonconsecutive days.  Do two to three sets of eight to 12 reps for each exercise you choose, according to the American College of Sports Medicine.  For abdominal training, you may need to do as many as 20 reps, but if you can keep going past that, you should pick a more challenging exercise.  Change your exercises every four to six weeks to see continual progress.",I live in a flat on the third floor.

You may also find damage to the floor itself as dropped weights puncture and crack the floor boards.  This type of damage is not only dangerous, but extremely costly to fix.  Noise is also a big concern.  Anything we do on the second floor will be amplified in the room underneath us.  Drop a dumbbell on the floor upstairs and the people downstairs are going to think the house is falling down.  Take a run on the treadmill and it will sound like you are herding elephants.  You can mitigate some of that noise with rubber matts and proper flooring.  You can also choose machines like rowers or ellipticals which are typically quieter overall ( see my recommended cardio machines here ).  In the end, though, you’re gonna need to let the folks downstairs know what’s going on so they don’t panic.  There are several great steps you can take to quiet your home gym, but if it’s upstairs, you simply can’t eliminate all of it.

On the basis of Kennedy’s findings, the Democratic leadership of the Senate decided to hold hearings on Watergate.  The result was the creation of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, the Ervin Committee, through which the nation learned of the White House tapes the specific cause of the drive to impeach Nixon.  In the most significant ways, the Dahlberg article represents the chief contribution of The Washington Post in the course of the Watergate scandal.

Unbeknownst to Barker, Liddy, and Sloan, the complete record of all such transactions was held for roughly six months.  Barker's use of foreign banks in April and May 1972, to deposit checks and withdraw the funds via cashier's checks and money orders, resulted in the banks keeping the entire transaction records until October and November 1972.  All five Watergate burglars were directly or indirectly tied to the 1972 CRP, thus causing Judge Sirica to suspect a conspiracy involving higher-echelon government officials.  On September 29, 1972, the press reported that John Mitchell, while serving as attorney general, controlled a secret Republican fund used to finance intelligence-gathering against the Democrats.  On October 10, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reported that the FBI had determined that the Watergate break-in was part of a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage on behalf of the Nixon re-election committee.

Five burglars had been caught red-handed in the complex, where the Democratic National Committee had its headquarters; one of them turned out to be an ex-CIA agent who did security work for the Republicans.  In the series of stories that followed, Bernstein and Woodward eventually connected the burglars to a massive slush fund and a corrupt attorney general.  Bernstein was the first to suspect that President Nixon was involved, and he found a laundered check that linked Nixon to the burglary.  Bernstein and Woodward's discoveries led to further investigations of Nixon, and on August 9, 1974, amid hearings by the House Judiciary Committee, Nixon resigned in order to avoid facing impeachment.   In 1974, two years after the Watergate burglary and two months before Nixon resigned, Bernstein and Woodward released the book 'All the President's Men'.

The square was then replaced by a colour bar on the main TV screen (showing every shade from black to white; with labels in 10 step increments from 0 to 100), and simultaneously, each participant was instructed on their own laptop screen whether they should type or say their answer on that trial. Participant 1 then made their response, followed by the other participants in ascending participant order.  On trials where any participant was instructed to type their response, their laptop would beep after two digits had been pressed using the numeric keyboard.  This acted as an auditory cue for the next participant to respond.  Participants were instructed they could respond using any number on the colour bar scale between 01 and 99.  At the end of the trial, all participants and the experimenter pressed the space bar to move the experiment onto the next trial.  The protocol began with 10 practice trials, followed by 153 trials in the main experiment, including a short break after each block of 51 trials.

Five burglars were actually in the DNC suite, while two others were across the street, watching from a hotel window.  It had been arranged that the lookouts would tell their five comrades to scatter if they saw a police car approaching; but because they didn’t recognize the unmarked car’s plainclothes passengers as police, they didn’t warn the burglars.  The police arrested both the burglars and the lookouts.  The next morning Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward attended the men’s arraignment.

Watergate Scandal - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.com Why did the burglars raid the Democratic campaign office?  John Dean tell us it was the result of a tip claiming the Democrat’s fundraising was engaging in illegal, or at least embarrassing, activities: Dean's new revelation is that the origin of the Watergate break-in was a 'tip' that Nixon received about an alleged Democratic fundraising kickback scheme and Nixon's subsequent desire for more information.  If Dean's revelation is correct, it would change the popular understanding of the origin of the Watergate break-in.  That's no small claim.  A reasonable person would then want to know more about the kickback scheme and the role that it may have played in the Watergate break-in and other 'dirty tricks' operations.

Some key members of CREEP (CRP) included: John N. Mitchell - Campaign Director Jeb Stuart Magruder - Deputy Campaign Manager Maurice Stans - Finance Chairman Kenneth H.

McCord, Jr., the former security coordinator of President Nixon’s re-election committee -- ended yesterday in conviction of all counts, the question remained unanswered. During cross examination of government witnesses, their attorneys quite expectedly have not pursued the lines of inquiry suggested by judge Sirica.  The government for its part, acknowledged that it knows the answers to many of the judge’s questions but contends they are more inferential than legally conclusive -- and therefore should not have been raised by the prosecution during the trial.  Last Friday, Sirica rejected the prosecution’s suggestion that he read the secret grand jury minutes of the case to find the answers to some of his questions, and said he would continue to interrogate witnesses when he felt it necessary.  He then ordered that testimony obtained by his own questioning of a key witness outside the presence of the jury, be read to the 12 members of the jury.  That testimony revealed that former Secretary of Commerce Maurice H. Stans, finance chairman of the Nixon campaign, and former Attorney General John N.

On May 19, Richardson appointed Elliot Cox as a special prosecutor, independent of the Justice Department.  Two days earlier, on May 17, the Watergate Committee began holding televised hearings.  These galvanized the country and provided an ongoing window in which the public was exposed to the various abuses of the Nixon campaign committee and the White House.  Beyond the dirty tricks of Segretti and others, The Watergate Committee took testimony on the ' Responsiveness Program ,' whereby administration friends were rewarded with government contracts and its enemies punished by denying access.

Cox was ultimately replaced by a second special prosecutor who did end up getting a hold of the disputed tapes.  Facing impeachment, Nixon would resign less than a year later.  Ken Gormley, author of a 1997 biography of Cox, described the decision to sack the special prosecutor as a devastating miscalculation for Nixon and the beginning of the end of his presidency.  “The Saturday night massacre,” Gormley wrote, “was the single event in his long and controversial political life from which Richard M. Nixon, president of the most powerful nation in the world, would never recover.”  It is unlikely anyone will say the same about Trump, despite the blistering outcry surrounding his decision to fire Yates.

During the investigation, White House aide Alexander Butterfield (1926–) revealed that Nixon had installed an audiotape system in the Oval Office, to secretly tape conversations with advisors for historical purposes.  Cox issued a subpoena, or court order, directing Nixon to give Cox some of the tapes.  Nixon responded by firing Cox.  Public outrage forced Nixon to appoint another prosecutor, Leon Jaworski (1905–1982), to continue the investigation.  On March 1, 1974, a grand jury charged U.S. attorney general John N.

Nixon was named as one of the conspirators, but he was not charged as an accused criminal.  In April 1974, Jaworski issued a subpoena, again asking Nixon to produce tape recordings of Oval Office conversations.

Hunt insisted they were looking for evidence that the DNC was receiving money from the North Vietnamese or Cuban governments.  Liddy has recently claimed the plan was to find information embarrassing to White House counsel John Dean.  Perhaps the most popular theory is that Nixon was worried that O'Brien knew about his financial dealings with billionaire tycoon Howard Hughes, for whom O'Brien served as a lobbyist in addition to his DNC duties.  A large loan from Hughes to Nixon's brother had become an issue in the 1960 presidential race (which Nixon lost narrowly), and when Nixon took office in 1969, Hughes reportedly gave him $100,000 (about $650,000 today) by way of the president's friend Charles 'Bebe' Rebozo, some of which, a 60 Minutes report alleged, went toward Nixon's house in Florida.  If that was in fact what the money was used for, it'd be natural for Nixon to fear what O'Brien could do with that knowledge.

After the five burglars were caught and the conspiracy was discovered—chiefly through the work of a few journalists, Congressional staffers and an election-finance watchdog official—Watergate was investigated by the United States Congress.  Meanwhile, Nixon's administration resisted its probes, which led to a constitutional crisis.   The term 'Watergate', by metonymy, has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration.  Those activities included such dirty tricks as bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious.  Nixon and his close aides also ordered investigations of activist groups and political figures, using the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as political weapons.",What effects did the Watergate scandal have on US politics?,train,"[[0.5158572196960449, 0.4841427505016327], [0.8207172155380249, 0.17928282916545868], [0.760785698890686, 0.23921430110931396], [0.84670090675354, 0.15329913794994354], [0.816616952419281, 0.1833830177783966], [0.874977707862854, 0.12502235174179077]]","[[0.07696428894996643, 0.013514101505279541], [0.9226219654083252, -0.5985919833183289], [0.7721399068832397, -0.3848520517349243], [1.0007457733154297, -0.7082105875015259], [0.924242377281189, -0.5693508386611938], [1.1158711910247803, -0.8298346400260925]]",0.4841427505016327,0.2273907313744227

One of the men arrested in the break-in of the Democratic National Headquarters, James McCord, was a “security consultant” for the Central Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.) and “security coordinator” for the “Committee to Re-elect the President” meaning Nixon.  As later revealed, Watergate was only part of a vast array of break-ins, wiretaps, and sabotage connected to Nixon.  58 Nixon’s rationalization of the Watergate burglary was that this type of political behavior was not unique to him, except that he got caught.  In fact, in his first congressional campaign, all of his pamphlets were stolen in a break-in at Republican Party Headquarters in California.  The pamphlets, costing $3,000, had been purchased with money received from his wife’s sale of a piece of land.  59 Was Nixon’s conduct in political office pretty much standard or was it significantly different and unethical?

However, owing to his prestige, he still commanded great moral authority, and the presidency acquired a greater role than the framers intended.

In fact, it was his concern with those earlier transgressions that gave rise to a post-Watergate political axiom: that the cover-up of the crime can be more damaging than the crime itself.  Nixon's creation of a secret police organization without congressional authorization—one that carried out an illegal break-in without a warrant, no less— would ultimately become a basis for one of the articles of impeachment brought against him by the House Judiciary Committee.  As Howard Hunt would put it in an angry memo as his prosecution moved forward, 'The Watergate bugging is only one of a number of highly illegal conspiracies engaged in by one or more of the defendants at the behest of senior White House officials.  These as yet undisclosed crimes can be proved.'

The recording subsequently became known as the Smoking Gun and led directly to Nixon’s resignation.  The release of the tape was ordered by the Supreme Court on July 24, 1974, in a case known as United States v. Nixon.  The court’s decision was unanimous.  President Nixon released the tape on August 5.  It was one of three conversations he had with Haldeman six days after the Watergate break-in.  The tapes prove that he ordered a cover-up of the Watergate burglary.  The Smoking Gun tape reveals that Nixon ordered the FBI to abandon its investigation of the break-in.

Resentment between China and the U.S. had lingered following the Korean War, during which China had fought against U.S. forces.  The visit marked the first time a U.S. president had visited the communist nation, which was then under the control of Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong.  Nixon's visit was an important step in improving relations between these two powerful nations.

Morison doubted Jesus’ resurrection and set out to analyze the historical record and prove that it was a myth.  Morison’s plan backfired.  His research convinced him of the validity of Christ’s resurrection, and he documented the long chain of evidence in his book, Who Moved the Stone?  (1930).  Many people have become Christians through reading Morison’s book, including Lee Strobel the former atheist and investigative journalist.  1 Watergate’s Liars Colson contends that lessons from Watergate suggest that the eyewitnesses of Jesus’ resurrection were trustworthy and reliable.  Watergate was a plot concocted by Nixon’s powerful aides.  But the fraud unraveled when one man, John Dean, testified against Nixon to save his own skin.  The cover-up and hoax held together only two weeks, then everybody jumped ship to save themselves.  Nobody’s life was at stake but they faced public embarrassment, disbarment, and prison.  Under pressure, many of Nixon’s top staff confessed they were lying.  Colson contrasts Watergate’s schemers with Christ’s apostles.

No evidence has been offered by anyone, including Woodward and Bernstein, that Segretti received any information from the Watergate group, and the putative fifty other Donald Segrettis have never been found, let alone linked to Watergate.

The behavior of the officials who steered Bernstein and Woodward onto this circuitous course makes in itself a revealing case study.

The Watergate scandal was a scandal during and after the 1972 Presidential Election.  United States President and Republican Richard Nixon was running for election against Democrat George McGovern.  Frank Wills, a security guard, discovered clues that former FBI and CIA agents broke into the offices of the Democratic Party and George McGovern months before the election.  These people listened to phone lines and secret papers were stolen.  When these men were found, it turned out that Nixon was involved and he had helped them cover it all up and might have even hired the men.  The Washington Post was a newspaper which played a big role in exposing the misdoings, specifically reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.  This showed the public that Nixon was not to be trusted, and society began to view him in a different light.  Nixon chose to resign from office on August 9, 1974 because he wished to not be impeached.  This means that he might have been charged with crimes.  The U.S. Congress could not impeach him if he resigned.

It was not immediately clear that the burglars were connected to the president, though suspicions were raised when detectives found copies of the reelection committee’s White House phone number among the burglars’ belongings.  In August, Nixon gave a speech in which he swore that his White House staff was not involved in the break-in.

A few days after the break-in, for instance, he arranged to provide hundreds of thousands of dollars in “hush money” to the burglars.  Then, Nixon and his aides hatched a plan to instruct the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to impede the FBI ’s investigation of the crime.

In order to prevent VCX from challenging the copyright on Deep Throat, Arrow Productions agreed in 2011 to voluntarily stop distributing Debbie Does Dallas and The Devil in Miss Jones, thus leaving their copyright status unresolved.

Felt never let Woodward or Bernstein quote him directly and at first only confirmed existing leads.  As the investigation unfolded, however, he offered some new information.  The moniker “Deep Throat” referred to a controversial but widely viewed pornographic film of the same name that was released in 1972.

Nixon claimed it was just a ‘witch hunt.’  In October of that year, Watergate was finally linked to Nixon when the FBI determined the operation was a massive setup of spying and sabotage by Nixon’s aides to support his re-election.

Anthropic arguments FHI has studied include the doomsday argument, which claims that humanity is likely to go extinct soon because it is unlikely that one is observing a point in human history that is extremely early.  Instead, present-day humans are likely to be near the middle of the distribution of humans that will ever live.  Bostrom has also popularized the simulation argument, which suggests that if we're likely to avoid existential risks, humanity and the world around are not unlikely to be a simulation.   A recurring theme in FHI's research is the Fermi paradox, the surprising absence of observable alien civilizations.  Robin Hanson has argued that there must be a 'Great Filter' preventing space colonization to account for the paradox.

He concludes that it is not only possible, but rather probable that we are living in a computer simulation.  This argument, originally published in 2001, shook up the field of philosophical ontology, and forced the philosophical community to rethink the way it conceptualizes “natural” laws and our own intuitions regarding our existence.  Is it possible that all of our ideas about the world in which we live are false, and are simply the result of our own desire to believe that we are “real”?  Even more troubling, if we are living in a computer simulation, is it possible that the simulation might be shut off at any moment?  In this paper, I plan to do two things.  First, I hope to consider what conclusions we might draw from Bostrom’s argument, and what implications this might have for how we affect our lives.

By reviewing the probability assignments that Bostrom has just given, it becomes clear that several things have to be the case.  Because the number of simulations run by a civilization capable of running them would be very great, if simulations are done, then the number of people that are simulated would be much greater than the number of people that are not simulated, which would mean that the probability that we are living in a simulated universe is almost unity.  So, it becomes clear that one of two things must be the case.  Either the probability that simulations are run is very small (practically null), or it is almost certain that we ourselves are living in a simulation.

The simulations he considered are different from those in movies like “The Matrix,” in which the world is simulated but the conscious minds are not—that is, where biological human beings with human brains interface with the simulated world.  In Bostrom’s simulations, human consciousness is just another figment of the simulation.  Bostrom assumes that the human mind is substrate-independent: that human consciousness isn’t strictly dependent on the biological brain itself, and that if we could physically replicate that brain in sufficient detail in another form (such as within a computer) it would also have the subjective experience of consciousness.  The replication doesn’t have to be perfect.  It just has to be good enough that the replicated being has a human-like subjective experience (a “mind”).

Even if high-fidelity computer Sims are never conscious, Dainton's reasoning leads to the following conclusion: either the fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage and are able and willing to run large numbers of neural ancestor simulations is close to zero, or we are in some kind of (possibly neural) ancestor simulation.",Which of Bostrom's 'simulation argument' trilemma is most likely?,test,"[[0.4306946396827698, 0.5693053603172302], [0.6244832873344421, 0.3755166530609131], [0.23017269372940063, 0.7698273062705994], [0.7431599497795105, 0.2568401098251343]]","[[-0.05189919099211693, 0.2271183878183365], [0.363778680562973, -0.14484307169914246], [-0.47152093052864075, 0.7358154058456421], [0.7378057241439819, -0.324651837348938]]",0.7698273062705994,0.49287235736846924

My first reaction to the iron pyrite cube was disbelief.  How could nature produce something so indistinguishable from modern technology?  Then I stumbled across Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom and his paper on the Simulation Argument.  His paper argues that: “At least one of the following propositions is true: (1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a “posthuman” stage; (2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof); (3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation.  It follows that the belief that there is a significant chance that we will one day become posthumans who run ancestor-simulations is false, unless we are currently living in a simulation.”  Could we have evolved from some deep universal technology!

At least this will be so unless the chances that creatures of our intelligence are doomed to become extinct before reaching the technological sophistication to create simulations are overwhelmingly large or else almost no such technologically capable civilizations have any interest in simulating minds like ours in the first place [  Bostrom, N., 2003].  Bostrom’s position owes nothing to skepticism, he is concerned solely with the question of whether virtual humans are empirically possible and, if so, how likely it is that we might be such beings.  His argument, if sound, makes it look very doubtful that we can know a priori that we are not brains-in-a-vat, when BIVs are understood to be virtual humans in a  simulation.

This does not prove that we are not living in a simulated universe.  It simply shows that the probability that we assign to our living in a simulated universe is not independent of the prior probability that we assign to the existence of universes other than our own.  Depending on the prior probability that we assign to this proposition, it is possible to deny the conjunction of the denials of the following three propositions: 1)  The probability that humanity will go extinct before reaching a posthuman stage is very close to unity; 2)  The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor-simulations is very close to zero; 3)  The probability that we are living in a simulation is very close to unity.

The argument The TAG is a transcendental argument that attempts to prove that God is the precondition for logic, reason, or morality.  The argument proceeds as follows: God is a necessary precondition for logic and morality (because these are immaterial, yet real universals).  People depend upon logic and morality, showing that they depend upon the universal, immaterial, and abstract realities which could not exist in a materialist universe but presupposes (presumes) the existence of an immaterial and absolute God.  Therefore, God exists.  If He didn't, we could not rely upon logic, reason, morality, and other absolute universals (which are required and assumed to live in this universe, let alone to debate), and could not exist in a materialist universe where there are no absolute standards or an absolute Lawgiver.",How would we know that we are living in a simulation?,train,"[[0.9732843041419983, 0.026715731248259544], [0.9540748000144958, 0.045925240963697433], [0.9850028157234192, 0.014997162856161594], [0.9882481694221497, 0.011751880869269371], [0.9760296940803528, 0.023970380425453186], [0.9923563003540039, 0.007643695920705795], [0.9652432799339294, 0.03475674241781235]]","[[1.9484790563583374, -1.6469446420669556], [1.6757324934005737, -1.3579946756362915], [2.231764793395996, -1.9530186653137207], [2.3508245944976807, -2.0810959339141846], [2.0009703636169434, -1.705703616142273], [2.5565249919891357, -2.309675931930542], [1.8133903741836548, -1.5106160640716553]]",0.045925240963697433,0.023680119243051325

But when there’s a sad or tragic event, French people collectively seem to focus on improving the situation or getting past it, rather than wallowing.  After 9/11, it was impossible to think of anything else.  Funny talk shows and other humor-related offerings stopped airing for a while.  On the other hand, almost immediately after the November 2015 terrorist attacks here in Paris, I was astonished and full of admiration for the fact that Parisians decided to deliberately sit outside at restaurant terraces.  It was a message that their lifestyle would not change, no matter what happened – a true “We do not negotiate with terrorists” if there ever was one.  In this way, C’est la vie really might be the appropriate overall French response to tragedy, whether you think the phrase is about feeling like this is how it is and there’s nothing we can do, or saying “This is how it is, now let’s move on and not let bad things stop us from living.”  Alysa Salzberg Alysa Salzberg is an American writer, worrier, teacher, and cookie enthusiast who has lived in Paris, France, for more than a decade.","Okay, so what do glitches in the simulation prove about our existence in it?",test,"[[0.9459170699119568, 0.05408291146159172], [0.9836279153823853, 0.016372034326195717], [0.9591339826583862, 0.04086604714393616], [0.9836493730545044, 0.016350694000720978], [0.985223650932312, 0.014776402153074741], [0.9179524183273315, 0.08204758167266846], [0.9412553310394287, 0.05874468386173248], [0.895318329334259, 0.10468164831399918]]","[[1.5858622789382935, -1.2757742404937744], [2.2098920345306396, -1.885780930519104], [1.7252062559127808, -1.4305250644683838], [2.1902151107788086, -1.9067838191986084], [2.2591989040374756, -1.9406383037567139], [1.3588279485702515, -1.0560182332992554], [1.5382851362228394, -1.2357286214828491], [1.2005099058151245, -0.9457456469535828]]",0.10468164831399918,0.04849025036673993

Following her Golden Globes speech, the actress — nominated for her 20th Oscar for her lead performance in Florence Foster Jenkins — was called ' highly overrated ' by Trump, which prompted Kimmel to make his own jokes about the actress.  Streep ultimately received a standing ovation from the Oscar crowd for the unprecedented amount of Academy Award nominations she's received throughout her career.  'We're also here to honor the actors who seem great, but actually really aren't,' Kimmel joked.  'And of all the 'great actors' here in Hollywood, one in particular has stood the test of time for her many uninspiring and overrated performances.'

In recent years, scientists have become interested in testing the theory.  In 2012, inspired by Professor Bostrom’s work, physicists at the University of Washington proposed an empirical experiment of the simulation hypothesis.  The details are complex, but the basic idea is simple: Some of today’s computer simulations of our cosmos produce distinctive anomalies — for example, there are telltale glitches in the behavior of simulated cosmic rays.  By taking a closer look at the cosmic rays in our universe, the physicists suggested, we might detect comparable anomalies, providing evidence that we live in a simulation.  Similar experiments were proposed in 2017 and 2018.  Professor Smoot captured the promise of these proposals when he declared, “You are a simulation and physics can prove it.”  So far, none of these experiments has been conducted, and I hope they never will be.  Indeed, I am writing to warn that conducting these experiments could be a catastrophically bad idea — one that could cause the annihilation of our universe.  Think of it this way.

Assign age-appropriate household chores When children contribute to family life in meaningful ways they feel more capable.  (Here’s a useful list of age-appropriate chores .)  BUT, Here’s the important bit… These are all very well, BUT if you’ve ever suffered from cripplingly low self-esteem you’ll know how difficult it is to make even the simplest of decisions.  Doing ordinary, basic, everyday stuff can seem TOO HARD.  And learning something new can feel IMPOSSIBLE.  If your child has hit rock bottom, giving choices and dishing out chores will only set them up for failure.  NOT what they need right now.  So what can you do?  Parenting expert, Dr Laura Markham, claims “only kids who feel completely loved are able to tackle and master hard things.”  You need to focus on the love and acceptance parts of the equation before you can expect your child to do the hard things that will make them feel capable.  2.",My son is 16 and super shy and awkward.

Some children who are shy go on to develop anxiety.  So if your child’s shy behaviour is significant and hard to change, it could help to talk to a professional like your GP, paediatrician or a psychologist.  Shyness or something else?  It’s a good idea to talk to your child and family health nurse (for young babies and toddlers) or your child’s teacher (for preschoolers and school-age children) to consider other possible reasons for your child’s behaviour.  For example: A child with a language delay might show signs that she wants to speak to people – for example, looking for eye contact or trying to make social connections – but get frustrated that she can’t be understood.

Support calms a child.  For example, telling her, “Don’t worry.  You’ll do better next time,” encourages her, restores her belief in herself, and helps her to build optimism.  Children need a positive self-esteem.  It is in your eyes, your words, your actions, and your smile that your child forms an image of himself.  Children desperately want to feel that they are valuable.  Giving your child a good feeling about himself, by protecting his self-esteem, is one of your greatest challenges as a parent.  The goal in working with this issue is to communicate with him positively, which means choosing your words and actions carefully.  Here are some guidelines for positive communication: Avoid criticism, for instance, telling your child, “You’re kicking the ball all wrong.”  These words will deflate your child’s self-image.  Avoid comparisons.  If you say, “Why can’t you be more like your younger brother and get good grades?” your child will feel inadequate.  Avoid negative adjectives.",How do I build my son's self-esteem when criticism is unavoidable?,train,"[[0.5103842616081238, 0.48961570858955383], [0.9295060634613037, 0.0704938992857933], [0.9597507119178772, 0.04024926573038101], [0.9598175883293152, 0.04018239304423332], [0.7535704970359802, 0.24642956256866455], [0.7793821096420288, 0.22061794996261597], [0.7533711194992065, 0.24662894010543823], [0.35333576798439026, 0.6466642618179321], [0.532364547252655, 0.4676353931427002], [0.5209325551986694, 0.47906747460365295], [0.7425106167793274, 0.2574893832206726], [0.5181268453598022, 0.48187318444252014], [0.7795259952545166, 0.2204739898443222]]","[[0.15920096635818481, 0.11765790730714798], [1.4162453413009644, -1.1628817319869995], [1.7089279890060425, -1.4626538753509521], [1.7170525789260864, -1.4562617540359497], [0.781414806842804, -0.3363315463066101], [0.8412532806396484, -0.42081567645072937], [0.7711188793182373, -0.3455541431903839], [-0.10690892487764359, 0.4974994659423828], [0.2330022007226944, 0.10336261987686157], [0.15406958758831024, 0.0702904537320137], [0.742215096950531, -0.3168436288833618], [0.17468735575675964, 0.10214824974536896], [0.8584951758384705, -0.40441107749938965]]",0.6466642618179321,0.3005708774121908

This will eliminate the chance for the two of you to have a productive discussion.[2] XResearch source Make a habit of pausing every time you feel emotionally triggered by your daughter.

Explain to your teen that we all have a negative inner critic that drives our thoughts at times.  The inner critic isn’t the problem; it’s what we choose to do with those critical thoughts that matter.  Share a few thoughts that run through your mind when your inner critic is loud.  Talk about how you feel as a result of those thoughts.  Finally, share ways you reframe those negative thoughts to refocus on positive thinking.  Helping teens learn to accept their negative emotions, state their negative thoughts, and reframe their thinking gives them the tools to cope with future rejection and other stressful events.  When we normalize the process, teens internalize these skills and are better able to use them when rejection occurs.  Rejection is inevitable, even if you, as a parent, try to avoid it for your child.  Your child will face rejection, but if you help them by using these tools, and instilling them with their own coping mechanisms, they will be able to move on from rejection.

Finding out your teen is pregnant can be emotionally devastating.  However, you should avoid criticism as much as you can.  Even if you feel your teen has made a huge mistake, criticizing her can backfire.  You do not want your teen to feel she cannot ask you for help as she makes a decision.  Your teen is probably already feeling bad and stressed out about the situation.  Nagging or criticizing her now will not help matters.  Therefore, it's best to avoid telling what she should have done.  Instead, try to be proactive and move forward in the present moment.

Speaking of parties, did you hear about the next school fundraiser?” Just move the conversation along and the attention away from your son.  When interactions are unavoidable (going to a seldom-seen relative or friend’s house), give your son some scripts.  As child development psychologist Gordon Neufeld says, this is not a teaching tool as much as it is a workaround for your son’s shyness and immaturity.  As time does its work and your son matures, he will get better at meeting people.  Until then, you can follow a little script of your own: “Harry, we are going to Grandma’s house.  We don’t see her a lot, so let’s practice smiling.”  You walk out of the room and pretend to be Grandma and smile at Harry.  If he smiles back, awesome.  If he runs, no worries.  Just reassure him and move along.  These little scripts and practice scenarios are just priming his young brain, giving him a foothold of safety.  They will never be perfect.  And don’t forget: You are the parent.

In response for the needs of children with autism, Romanczyk has suggested for adapting comprehensive model of social acquisitions with behavioral modification rather than specific responses tailored for social contexts.  Anxiety and Depression Individuals with few opportunities to socialize with others often struggle with social skills.  This can often create a downward spiral effect for people with mental illnesses like anxiety or depression.  Due to anxiety experienced from concerns with interpersonal evaluation and fear of negative reaction by others, surfeit expectations of failure or social rejection in socialization leads to avoiding or shutting down from social interactions.  Individuals who experience significant levels of social anxiety often struggle when communicating with others, and may have impaired abilities to demonstrate social cues and behaviors appropriately.  The use of social media can also cause anxiety and depression.

Taking turns: Turn-taking can be taught through the use of social stories and by using a picture or pictograph to cue your child.  You may also need to teach turn taking when it comes to activities, not just speaking.  You can practice this by playing games and activities that involve 2 or more players and require taking turns.  For example, the card game “Go Fish” requires you to take turns playing and speaking but it’s also is predictable – You ask for a card, if the other player has the card, they’ll give it to the other, if they don’t they will say “Go Fish”.",How do I help to improve my son's social skills?,train,"[[0.8646690845489502, 0.13533085584640503], [0.9463555216789246, 0.053644441068172455], [0.8354173898696899, 0.16458259522914886], [0.46690791845321655, 0.5330920219421387], [0.5728538036346436, 0.42714622616767883], [0.4632818102836609, 0.5367181897163391], [0.8900547027587891, 0.10994529724121094]]","[[1.0810461044311523, -0.7735781073570251], [1.5716105699539185, -1.298629879951477], [0.992830216884613, -0.6316887736320496], [0.09087687730789185, 0.22343885898590088], [0.285604864358902, -0.007899316027760506], [0.10420238971710205, 0.25134000182151794], [1.188529372215271, -0.9027705192565918]]",0.5367181897163391,0.2800656610301563

Teenagers are often self-conscious and anxious about their bodies and appearance.  So reinforce the positive aspects of your child’s social and emotional development.  For example, you could praise your child for being a good friend, or for having a wide variety of interests, or for trying hard at school and so on.  It’s easy to get caught up in your children’s needs.  There’s also the day-to-day business of getting children to the sporting and social activities that are important for their development.  Even with all this going on, looking after yourself and making time for the things you enjoy can keep you feeling positive about parenting your teenage child.  Staying connected with your teenage child can be an important part of supporting your child’s social and emotional development.  You can check out our Talking to Teens interactive guide to see how different approaches to staying connected can get different results.

When many consumers search for products in the search engines, not only are they looking at the 'Web' results, but they're also looking at the 'images' results.  If you have quality images of that product on your site -- and the files' names contain relevant keywords -- these images will rank well in search engines.  This avenue will drive a lot of traffic to your site, as potential customers will click on that image to find your store.

Let's be realistic, though: As digital natives, your children are going to be immersed in that world, so such a defensive posture is probably not going to be adequate in safeguarding your children against its ill effects on the formation of a healthy self-identity.  Here are some recommendations on how to develop your children's self-identity amid the cacophony of messages they're getting from media.  Inoculate Your Children Against Media's Messages You can help your children resist media's messages by priming them for those messages.  When you consistently offer your children contrasting perspectives, you prime them to stand firm against the unhealthy messages.  You can actively teach them 'executive functioning' skills, such as impulse control, critical thinking and long-term planning, that will further gird them against the unhealthy messages.  You can also help your children become sensitive to media's messages which will enable them to recognize those messages for what they are and see them with a healthy skepticism.",How do I prevent social media from impacting my son's self-esteem?,train,"[[0.25347480177879333, 0.7465251684188843], [0.5005543231964111, 0.4994456470012665], [0.90821772813797, 0.09178221225738525], [0.3852792978286743, 0.6147207021713257], [0.8589839339256287, 0.14101600646972656], [0.5439367890357971, 0.45606330037117004], [0.8523412346839905, 0.14765873551368713]]","[[-0.33182966709136963, 0.7483352422714233], [0.12399996817111969, 0.1217825785279274], [1.285129427909851, -1.0069360733032227], [-0.005749044008553028, 0.4614504277706146], [1.072870135307312, -0.7340066432952881], [0.21108652651309967, 0.03488505631685257], [1.0582038164138794, -0.6948793530464172]]",0.7465251684188843,0.3853159674576351

Basic needs of food, water can be met but when an individual feels he’s not being recognized this might cause depression.  2  . Adults and teenagers who engage too much on social media might experience restricted health activities.  Meaning they are not performing any physical activity or doing any brainstorming that might bring them a sense of worthiness.  If excessive time is spent on social media people stop feeling happy that gives them the feeling of self-satisfaction.  3. Lack of self-confidence also causes depression, and this happens when you start comparing yourself with others.  In doing so people forget who they are following usually use a lot of photo editing.  Moreover, what they see is not real.  4.  Excessive social media usage influences mood typically leading to emotional sadness and lack of sleep.  How To Minimize The Effect Of Social Media That Causes Depression?  1.  Pay Attention to what is real Individuals are more prone to develop loneliness when they compare their lives to others.

Get Your Family Active A healthy lifestyle is a teen's best defense against being or becoming overweight.  Plan fun, physically active activities for the whole family to enjoy.  Make them a part of your daily/weekly routine, a fun habit and try not to turn them into a chore.  Be a role model and enjoy the activities with your kids.  Try not to make it a special occasion, but something that you just do all the time together.

We tend to think of the world in segments: countries, people, languages, cities, etc.  However, the world, when thought of as a whole, is a very interesting place in and of itself.  Famous bowls in India are also regularly found in Mexico.  The German Schnitzel is very similar to the Mexican milanesa.  As different as cultures are, there are also a ton of similarities.  Here are a few interesting facts that really help make our world a fun place to live.  There are over 6,000 languages spoken in the world today, many of which are spoken by fewer than a few hundred people.  The top 10 or 12 languages however make up the vast majority of all of the speakers in the world.  Mexicans celebrate New Years Eve by eating 12 grapes at the stroke of midnight.  This tradition is actually fairly common among Latin American countries and dates back to their ancestors.  Puero Ricans invented the Pina Colada - the delicious coconut based drink.

The song was also included in the 1983 film Breathless.  The original Sam Cooke version of the song comprised the title soundtrack of the 2005 film Hitch .  After a Greg Chapman cover of the song was featured prominently in the 1985 film Witness in a scene where Harrison Ford dances with Kelly McGillis, 'Wonderful World' gained further exposure.  Particularly in the United Kingdom, where a copy of the song, produced by Karl Jenkins and Mike Ratledge and with vocals sung by Barbadian Tony Jackson, a backing singer for Paul Young, appeared in 'Bath', a well-remembered, Roger Lyons-directed 1985 advertisement for Levi's 501 jeans.  As a result, the Sam Cooke version of the song became a hit in the UK, reaching No.2 and selling a certified 250,000 copies.  In a 2005 poll by the UK's Channel Four the song was voted the 19th-greatest song ever to feature in a commercial.

In my book Wake Up to Wonder, I describe how parts of nature commonly found around the world – the sun, water, rocks, trees, and flowers – reveal more about the mystery of who God is and how we can relate to him.  Mysteries can spark your curiosity to seek God more – and when you do, you can encounter wonder that will expand your perspective.  Mysteries Show That God Values Lifelong Learning When you encounter a mystery, you’re challenged to go beyond the limits of what you know, what you understand, and what you think is possible.  Mysteries challenge you to step out of your comfort zone.  They call you to evaluate and expand the ways you think and feel, opening doors for you to walk through to wonder.

Keen released 'Wonderful World' in competition with RCA's issue of 'You Understand Me' in the same week.  'Wonderful World' quickly became Cooke's best-performing single since his first hit 'You Send Me,' reaching number 12 on the 'Billboard' Hot 100 and number two on the magazine's Hot R&B Sides chart.  'Billboard' reviewed the single upon its release, giving it four stars and writing, 'Moderate rocker gets a smooth belt from Sam Cooke in his usual, salable style.'   In 2004, the song was placed 373rd in 'Rolling Stone' magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.   Section::::Later versions.   Herman's Hermits had a major hit in the mid-1960s with an uptempo version of the song (omitting one verse) which reached number four in the US and number seven in the UK.  The Hermits' version was, according to singer Peter Noone and guitarist Keith Hopwood, done as a tribute to Cooke upon his death.   Otis Redding recorded a version of the song on his 1965 album 'Otis Blue'.",Why did Larry Newton dislike “What a wonderful world” by Louis Armstrong?,train,"[[0.9912635087966919, 0.0087365061044693], [0.9922879934310913, 0.00771203963086009], [0.9914427399635315, 0.008557266555726528], [0.9877294898033142, 0.012270472012460232], [0.9943282008171082, 0.0056718201376497746], [0.9958969354629517, 0.004103115759789944], [0.9932217597961426, 0.006778269074857235], [0.9909504652023315, 0.009049528278410435], [0.9933848977088928, 0.006615110673010349]]","[[2.515963077545166, -2.2155067920684814], [2.5752298831939697, -2.282000780105591], [2.5220179557800293, -2.2303621768951416], [2.3579578399658203, -2.0302555561065674], [2.7229223251342773, -2.4436347484588623], [2.8693132400512695, -2.6225838661193848], [2.6402688026428223, -2.346963405609131], [2.5025720596313477, -2.1933798789978027], [2.6439263820648193, -2.367835283279419]]",0.012270472012460232,0.007721569803025987

Although the comedy album boom was mushrooming by 1962, production of a record imitating the president met stiff opposition.  James Hagerty, a top executive for ABC-Paramount Records and President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s former press secretary, said the proposed album would be 'degrading to the presidency' and proclaimed that 'every Communist country in the world would love this record.'  After other rejections, Cadence Records agreed to take on the project, and within a month the record was appearing on store shelves, and seeing brisk sales.  Within two weeks it had sold more than 1 million copies, pushing past the debut album by Peter, Paul and Mary.

Pink: Adam Grant, [  the youngest tenured professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania] finished a study this summer.  The research shows extroverts are more likely to take sales jobs, extroverts are more likely to get hired, and extroverts are more likely to get promoted.  But if you look at the link between extroverts and sales performance, strong extroverts only did a little better than the strong introverts.  The classic glad-handing extroverts only did a little bit better than the introverts cowering in the corner.  The people who did best by far — and it is not even close — were the people in the middle.  Why are the extroverts not very good?  They don’t listen.  They are too pushy.

The fact that the book has sold 5 million copies is printed on the cover of the current edition in both paperback and hard cover, and directly contradicts exaggerated claims that the book has sold more than 20 million copies in 42 languages.  The publisher also contradicts the translation claim, saying the book has been translated into only 15 languages.  Nearly half of the sales of the book (2.1 mil.) occurred before 1958, and by 1963, the book had still only sold 2 million copies according to Peale.  Since then, the book has sold less than 3 million copies over the past 60 years.  Some of his other popular works include 'The Art of Living', 'A Guide to Confident Living', 'The Tough-Minded Optimist', and 'Inspiring Messages for Daily Living'.

The industry was on a tear in 2015, running at or above a torrid sales pace of 18 million for much of the year.  The comeback of the US market has been stunning.  Sales plunged below 10 million in the depths of the Great Recession .  Back then, no one was sure if there would ever be anymore records broken.  Still, it could have been a better 2015.  Some analysts surveyed by Bloomberg — at consumer-auto information resources such as Kelley Blue Book, True Car, and Edmunds and at big investment banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan — thought the selling pace for December would pull the yearly total up close to 18 million.  And although everybody except Volkswagen, still reeling from its emissions-cheating scandal, notched gains, some car makers finished December a bit light against expectations.  At Ford, for example, US sales rose 8% in December to 239,242 vehicles.  Analysts expected an increase of 11%.  Also lighter than expected were sales from GM and Fiat Chrysler.  Ford and GM slipped in regular trading on Tuesday, down about 2% and 3%, respectively.

Ministry, the 700 club Posted by Cee Harmon Categories: Ministry Outreach TV Elevate Christian Network :: Ministry Outreach TV Jesus is love the Lord wants you in every respect of your life to prosper and be in health but it’s as here soul prospers and so that means he wants your soul to be whole he wants your mind your will your emotions your your faculties of passion in that just to be aligned with him and so today we have a guest that is an expert in this field it’s Katie Souza from expected and ministries and Katie you’ve been studying into this area of the soul and healing for the Soul for a long time now but not only studying you’ve actually been applying with your faith the redemptive power of Jesus Christ his healing blessing is his deliverance power and people are set free all over the world because of your ministry and so we’re just thrilled to have you with us today on the program and I know that you’ve got lots of good nuggets for us so let’s talk about the healing of the soul why is it important well for me it started out as necessity of getting this revelation because I was getting sick with all kinds of things reoccurring issues that would never go away at bladder infections yeast infections sore throats flus fevers and it seemed like I was doing what I’m supposed to do you know I was praying believing the crane and I wasn’t getting the breakthrough and so I knew there was something missing and I didn’t understand what it was and that’s when God began to you know speak to me through that scripture that will prosper and be in health even as our soul prospers and God began to show me how certain things like sin and trauma can wound our souls right you know isaiah 30:26 in the amplified talks about god healing up the brokenhearted and binding up their wounds that came from their sin right so saying that when we sin or when somebody sins against us or ancestors sin it can literally wound us okay and even like for trauma that traumas that we live through divorces losing jobs our children maybe someone passes away in our life those traumas can also wound our soul man you know and a good example of that and the Bible is job remember he went through a lot of trauma right he had all his servants killed and all his his wealth was stolen his children were all killed at the same time when a whirlwind you know crashed the house down on on them and then he himself even got sick physically well those traumas wounded his soul and we know that because throughout the entire book of Job 23 times he says stuff about his soul like I’m mourning and so on vexed and soul my soul is being poured out and it was always him making these statements in connection to the pain the soul pain he was feeling over those traumas and you know Katie if if your soul isn’t that much pain it’s going to affect your quality of life in the same way that if your body like has an injury like let’s say someone you know cut your your arm and you know your tendons are all damaged and everything else then that arms not going to function right and you’re not going to have quality of life so we can’t ignore this area of soul healing in the same way as we wouldn’t be able to ignore the need for a physical healing yeah and even doctors will say that when you live through a traumatic event or something has stressed you and your inner man they don’t even really necessarily call it my soul but they say that 80 to 90% of their patients that have a serious even a deadly illness right have suffered some sort of a event like that than traumatising to them so what happens in here directly affects everything out here including the physical body right and you know when as we go around teaching people how to get healed in their soul we see thousands and thousands of miracles I mean I saw a man grow a lung back right he lost from cancer win without soul healed Wow and I believe the soul the wound that was inside him actually caused the cancer in the first place yeah see a good a good biblical example of sickness and the soul is the man at the Pool of Bethesda remember him said he he had an infirmity for thirty-eight years right that’s a long time to be sick and a lot of people are in that situation exactly today yeah there’s so many mysterious illnesses that even the doctors don’t know how to diagnose because they don’t know how to diagnose the soul hmm I think that’s one of the issues right for the amount of the pool 38 years what was it that made him in that state for that long right well the Bible says he had an infirmity for 38 years if you look at that word infirmity in the Strong’s it means weakness and infirmity of the body and of the soul so was saying that he had wound inside of his inner man that was causing the sickness now where did that wound come front right well it came from sin and we know that from the words of Jesus himself when did he say that man after he got him healed he saw him in the temple he said I see your well now stop sinning right or something worse may happen to you see when we sin or someone sins against us or our ancestors sinned it can wound us and then cause disease right come upon us yeah for sure for sure even demonic oppression you know we see a lot of people you know they’re doing they’re making more with the enemy and and they’re doing what the Bible says to do you know no weapon formed against us shall prosper greater is He that’s in me than he that’s in the world the name of Jesus I command you to leave but they’re not having success or battling that spear and it’s not leaving it could be not every time but it could be because there is a legal landing strip is solely for that spirit to be there and a good example is the woman bowed over with the spirit of infirmity remember her 18 years right her spine is literally bent by a spirit a demon was bending her spine that is like almost beyond our ability to proceed right but nonetheless that’s what the Bible said right so what was allowing that spirit to literally affect her bones like that well it said she had a spirit of infirmity right the same word used to describe the man at the pool right it means infirmity and weakness in the soul right so she had something going on in here that allowed the spirit to be there once we get this healed we’ll start to see a lot of things change will start to see miracles happen in our bodies our minds our marriages our relationships our finances we’ll see our authority over demonic spirits will greatly increase right I mean today Katie you know like there’s a lot of I think frivolous thinking regarding sin issues in the body of Christ I see it everywhere it’s like oh well I’m under grace oh that’s fine it doesn’t matter you know but it really does and the reason why God hates sin so much is because it can damage you or it says it hurts us and he hates anything that hurts us so we don’t want to go navel-gazing as far as oh I’m going to keep looking because if your sin conscious that’s going to destroy you also yes it is but we don’t want to ignore the fact that right that our souls need to be rightly stewarded watch over are your hearts with all diligence because from it flow the issues of life scripture says it’s true you know just like simple things like being offended at somebody let’s say somebody really does you wrong and they really have hurt you and you’ve really not done anything to deserve it right what happens is some people mistakenly respond by becoming offended saying words that person I can’t believe what they did you know how they have the nerve you know they need to repent they’re completely wrong and we begin to complain and be offended well the Bible says in like proverbs 16 I believe it is or proverbs 26 it says the words of a slander or a whisper are like deadly wounds yeah that go down to the innermost part of the being so we think we have the right right you say stuff about this person because they did this and this and this and this right but we’re actually putting deadly wounds on ourselves and causing sickness point oh yeah one of the times I heard you speak on offense it was really enlightening because I think you were sharing a testimony about how you’re walking through an airport and going through the security lines and you’re offended because of you know someone not moving fast enough attending and you know so often things like that happened in all of our lives right every day but we we don’t even think its offense because you know it just feels like you know we’re you know we have a right to say it we have a right to think it I mean after all and it just becomes natural to us but God wants us to come to a place where we are so in tune with his love yes and with his purity and everything that that that will realize no that’s not his nature right it’s not him thinking gosh that’s why I’m feeling like that and so that we can walk free from woundedness by by by being in the healers love in the in in wholeness himself we gotta connect the dots I remember this gentleman in like San Diego he had a severe sinus affection and he had it for years and years and it was so bad it stunk okay was always running and you could smell it people around him could smell it was that bad why when talk about the soul at a meeting and about being offended and he said the prayers and he got instantly healed it dried up the smell left and everything and he was amazed because he never connected this horrible infection with him being offended and it wounding his soul Wow yeah it was amazing yeah well and so one round of repentance and cleansing cleansed everything yes it’s true oh and there’s another thing there too you know i lead people through repentance and that’s the first step we should always particular cross first because jesus died for every sin right including every sin that would ever wound us but there’s something i think that the body of christ is left out of their daily prayer life and that is for taking of something they already have and that’s Dunamis resurrection power that lives in them right so let me just explain what that is okay so the Bible talks about in Romans 1 that we that Paul said I’m not ashamed of the gospel which is the power unto salvation right he’s talking about this power that caused us to become saved born again it’s resurrection power it comes into us and it causes our dead spirit to be resurrected in the new eternal life right right okay will that power that Paul is talking about there in the Greek gets the word Dunamis now this is a this is an amazing power right okay Dunamis is resurrection power it causes us to be born again it comes and lives inside of us so right now every believer has a tankful that never runs out right okay well that word Dunamis if you look it up in the Strong’s one of its meanings is excellence of soul yes I love it so we don’t realize right now we got a tank full oh yeah power that can make us excellent a soul I can heal every single wound we already have it because Jesus is excellent of soul and he is eternal life and he’s dwelling within us and when you just think of like this excellence of Jesus and thought word and indeed lives in on the inside and the heat comes in fills our human soul oh that’s how we’re taken into his image his likeness because he’s living in there and he’s given us that power to heal every bit of woundedness that could ever come upon us when we talked about anything else that we do awesome yes you know we are going to come right back after this message but I want you to get ready to be ministered to we’re going to learn about the power of decree and how decrees can heal your soul there’s going to be miracles and we’re going to pray for those things and if

again twenty two speakers unite at the historic angeles temple to relight the revival fires and release an atmosphere of miracles signs and wonders it’s time for you to arise and be a woman on the front lines okay so Katie tell us more about this Dunamis power because it’s one thing to be able to you know recognize that there’s a need for repentance and that yeah but repentance is one thing but applying that Dunamis power is another yes you know you gotta know for sure that it works cuz Jesus used it that’s what acts 10:38 says God anointed Jesus Christ with Holy Spirit and power which is Dunamis and he went around healing everyone that was oppressed by the devil and when the woman touched Jesus’s the hem of His garment ruin oh right says he felt that healing virtue that word is Dunamis and she had been traumatized by that 12u her long says so I believe he healed her in her soul made her excellence all and healed her physical bodies and even if the issue of blood itself wasn’t related to the soul yeah the shame and everything that came with that condition would have damaged the soul and that’s what I loved about that whole story is that he presented her after she was healed he made sure publicly everyone knew that she was cleansed yeah it’s clear that whole issue I love to care everything he took care of everything Jesus all right now seriously okay so decrees is another good thing now you’re the decree expert you know I’ve read your book the trade and it’s awesome I think everyone needs to incorporate decrees it’s one of the simple ways that you can release the power you already have because if your blood you have and a decree is a governmental proclamation yeah we’ve got the King of Kings the word of the King of Kings that we decree and the the Bible says that when you send forth that word through decree you know that word does not return void it accomplishes everything it is sent to do so it’s powerful it’s active its operative as it says in Hebrews and is so powerful decrees are so powerful yeah you know job talks on we decree a thing and it shall be and she’ll be established so that helps establish and our healing for us in her soul and in her body right it’s so cool cuz you know Jesus made decrees when he would heal people you know he went around saying to people that were crippled and stuff arise right pick up your mat and walk he was releasing a decree to them except well that were to rise it’s so cool because if you look it up but it’s actually a resurrection term it’s the same term used for you know the when when Jairus daughter arose right and when Jesus command us go out heal the sick raise the dead so when he would say to people arise pick up your Matlock he was loosing a decree that was releasing the Dunamis he was carrying beautiful you know and it would heal that person in their in her soul and in their physical body right so that’s what we need to start doing too is start releasing decrees you know that’s why I wrote the book so that people could have a list of them if they didn’t know what to do that it’s called soul a soul decrees and so these are specific decrees to heal the soul and to empower the soul and to come into healing wholeness and an empowerment it’s awesome when they do them then the physical body will follow suit their marriage will follow suit you know every part of them will follow suit their finances will start to prosper right so it’s a good practice that’s a very simple but totally effective way is releasing the Word of God though that’s what James says the word has the power to save our soul yes you know that word say there is so so so it means holy deliver prosper yes awesome using we’ve seen so many things happen and in our in our you know meetings and in our personalized to and it happened through a decree right like I would get a word of knowledge and I would stand on the stage and make a decree say a scripture or say a decree you know I hear someone’s being healed of you know knee problems right now someone being healed of cancer I find and I would speak a scripture and I command that your soul would be prospered by health even as your body would be prospered and brought my health even as your soul prospers and then you know miracles that start to pop pop pop pop pop so it’s very simple for us to do this but so very powerful and Katie you actually have in your ministry you train people how to operate in this it’s not like you’re just up there on the platform doing this just yourself you actually equipped the body to do this and I know people have been under your training we’re out ministering to the sick feeling people’s souls casting out Devils all of that and so thank you so much for your contribution yeah because it’s amazing it’s been super fun but you know people don’t feel like they need me to lay hands on them because I’m teaching them how to do it right you know we’ve just even you know even in my own inner circle my staff and people in in my family in my ministry are getting huge miracles signs and wonders because they’ve learned how to do it you know one of my my very faithful employees john blake had a rare disease where he had ammonia storing in his brain right his body wasn’t releasing it and it would cause him like alzheimer’s like symptoms right he wouldn’t be able to remember remember simple tasks like typing he wouldn’t be able to finish his sentences his wife would have to finish him for him he wouldn’t be able to remember the plot of a movie even though he just watched the movie it was horrible he would spend like $1,500 a month on medications that would prevent him from going into a coma like sleep Wow it was terrible for him and God just released a word a nagy one day to us said it was his soul that there was an issue in the soul and then if we prayed for it it would be healed and he would be healed too and he came over the house and I just you know I prayed over him a decrese soaked him and within I don’t know probably 45 minutes he stood up and the first thing he recognized was that his mind was clear Wow he he could think so much clearer than he had in years and years and then he went home and all his life he’d had this smell of ammonia on his body and all of a sudden he gets in the shower to take a shower and it’s gone right he’s so convinced after the days you know past that he’s healed he has three of his doctors to give a test independently each one all comes back first time in years his ammonia level is normal it’s awesome it was awesome awesome a lot of times people think that you know like when the soul gets healed and then the physical body responds but it also affects other areas I can there John it says in every respect yes in all respects of life I want you to prosper and be in health even as your soul prospers so that could be also your prosperity of provision yes your prosperity of relationships and that and you’ve seen miracles in those areas as well especially in financial breakthroughs in people’s lives and you know as you yes you know seeing clearance in the area of the soul then other things come into alignment as well I’ve had huge financial miracles given to me and the ministry because I got my soul healed and it was so cool God would always connect the miracle with the provision coming in like something would happen I would have an awareness that there was an issue my soul like I’m sure most reviewers know my history I think I used to be a criminal in the streets I would rob people I knew in federal prison I was a federal prison I sold dope I was a collector I forced people to pay debts by gunpoint and I remember when the ministry started really taking off the Lord said you can’t continue to carry around those wounds in your soul that came from all that sin right because now I have to trust you to steward faithfully right and with integrity millions of dollar right and that’s no joke and we take that seriously I mean we’re members of the ECF a that’s how serious and I just want to say knowing you personally for like since you started in ministry really is I want to say how much I appreciate your integrity you’re a woman of virtue you are a woman who truly has watched over her soul and you watch over the finance of the ministry as unto the Lord in such a beautiful way and I want to commend you for that and your husband and your team we have gone out of our way we have independent audits done on us all the time to make sure that every eye you know is dotted every T is crossed and we’ve done really well in that we feel really happy that God has allowed us to work in that in that level of integrity but in all we can’t just say well let me just say this because I think this is so important there are so many Christiane’s you know you’re saved you’re you’re you know you you love the Lord but when you don’t watch over your soul in the area financial stewardship and when you don’t have integrity in that area how can we be trusted with true riches how can we really steward what God has us to Stewart so I just want you to examine your heart so you know and say am i stewarding my finances the way that God wants me to store them and especially if you’re a Christian minister and you are storing the funds that come into the ministry I know @xp we are very very serious about the way funds are handled and that nothing gets wasted and that we’re we’re careful with expenditures in that and so please you know I just make an appeal to you to make sure there’s alignment in that area and I think let me go to that see when we have woundedness inside of us it controls every part of our soul the way we think about the money the decisions we make with the money and we can even get emotional with the money and and we have to be healed in our soul right now in that parable of the talents remember the master leaves and goes his servants talents we said that he gave three of his servants talents according to their abilities right did you know that word ability there is the word Dunamis really well you can almost read it like this excellence of soul right it means that he gave them talents according to the exercise oh wow we have the Dunamis in notes we all have the same mana tournament yeah we all have a tankful that never runs out but how much of it is that working us right how much of in are we releasing how much are we going okay I I want to make sure I am totally operating with utmost integrity in my finances so I want and releases Dunamis I already have from my spirit in my soul to heal every wound in my soul that might be connected to finances right I repent for anything I’ve done you know bad stewardship wastefulness AXS extortion anything an enemy soul that needs money to make it feel good yeah you know the idolatry of it yes I remember some people there are adorable people that love Jesus they had gotten an inheritance and they called me so would you please help us decide what to to you know invest in and so I began to pray with them and I said you know I feel like you’re supposed to wait until you get more healing in your soul before you move on then that night the the wife has a dream she has a huge diamond and these zombies are trying to steal it from her she calls me and tells me the dream and I said oh my gosh it’s what I told you see zombies are the walking dead right that’s what soul wounds are there are things that are supposed to be dead but they’re still alive and kicking and they’re trying to eat your stuff Wow okay and I said they’re trying these soul wounds are gonna try to steal your diamond your watch don’t make a move until you get more healing they didn’t listen though and they lost it all oh they lost every penny we have to be so careful we need to be healed in here first yes then God will give us more finances because he can trust us and when you make decrees over your soul that actually helps fortify the healing though we just have a couple minutes left I love to minister to the people so why don’t you go as a spirit lead too and let’s release healing to soul wounds all right let’s work on the finances because so many people need help in that area let’s just ask God to first cleanse us of any sin we might have committed with our finances so why don’t we just pray together okay just say Lord Jesus our repent for anything sinful that I have done with my finances our repent for excess bad stewardship extortion gambling Ussery manipulation in Jesus name all sin I’ll repent for that’s connected to my finances I put the blood of Jesus on it I’m just saying into that okay now let’s do the second step because if you don’t if you don’t start releasing Dunamis in you you won’t become excellent of soul that wound will still be their sins gone but the wound stays behind controlling you okay so not just put your hand on your belly and just say Jesus I released what I already have I have a tank full of Dunamis and I release it now to go into my soul to every woundedness in me that’s controlling my finances send Dunamis into my mind so I think right thoughts about money send it to my will so I get healed and make right decisions about my money and send it into my emotions so I don’t make emotional decisions with my finances to say I release the Dunamis now decree I am excellent of soul in Jesus name Amen awesome thank you so much Katie we want to thank you so much for joining us on today’s program and I’d love for you to visit us at XP ministries.com and especially look up

I’m going to actually begin at the first verse and then I’ll try to call it out as I go but I’m excited for God’s a word thank you praise team band everybody for taking us into the presence of the Lord beginning at the first verse the Bible said sometime later the Moabites and the ammonites accompanied by the me unites they join forces to make war on Jehoshaphat verse 3 shaken Jehoshaphat prayed because sometimes when you really shake it to the cordless that’s what you do so shaken Joseph had prayed and he went to God for help and he ordered a nationwide fast the country of Judah United in seeking God’s help and they came from all the cities of Judah to pray to God go to verse 25 and when Jehoshaphat and his people came to carry off the plunder they found more loot than they could carry off equipment clothing valuables as a matter of fact it took three days to cart it away and on the fourth day they came together at the valley of blessing Baraka and they blessed God that’s how it got its name the valley of blessing now just a few verses earlier in verse three shaken some translations say was trouble he was worried he was bothered but here now just a few late verses later and there’s a whole lot of stuff that happened in between and I’m gonna try to hit the highlights of it today but I want to just talk for a few moments from a particular subject look to your neighbor on your right and say neighbor being overwhelmed by the battle – being overloaded by the blessing tell somebody else being overwhelmed by the battle to being overloaded by the blessing it all happened in a day’s journey from overwhelmed to overloaded well not just overloaded with troubles of burden of pressure but overloaded by the blessing sphere to God we thank you for your word it’s a timely word we honor you your word is always on time I pray for the anointing to deliver it into this room thank you for touching your people thank you for speaking confirmation in this house somebody came to hear have your way in here today God take over this room right now just take it over see what you want to say and do what you want to do and will thank you for it in Jesus name somebody just stand there for a second clap your hands and give God a praise in advance come on praise Him in advance for finding you today for speaking to you today for giving you a word that you can walk out here with and live with all week long thank you too dad god I thank you today for your word in Jesus name Amen and amen on your way down just hit somebody tell him from overwhelmed too overloaded overwhelmed to overload it y’all got to say Amen real loud because I can’t really see y’all good because the lights are in my face so I know you out there cuz of philia but say man every now and then thank you thank you y’all are awesome one of the most common complaints that that I hear or common phrases or common sentences or words that I hear today and probably you here too is is the phrase I am just over well over well now most of the time the people who say that they’re telling you the truth because there is a lot today that we can find ourselves overwhelmed by there’s this there’s just too many decisions that have to be made there’s one of the worst things I can stand it is when I you know cuz I will usually spend Saturday prepping for today and I come in here and preach this first service out preach second service and when church is over if my I can’t take it when my family looks at me and says where are we going to eat I just want to bop him upside the head cuz I haven’t been listening and hearing and I’ve been focused and I’ve been delivering and I made a I’ve made a hundred decisions in the last 24 hours if not more on what we’re doing right here right now and so the last thing that I want you to say to me is where are we going to eat so if you have a catering business we would love frite no I’m just kidding I’m just kidding most of the time I want to go home and go to bed because I’m just wore out but but I feel like it can just in case somebody one somebody make a decision on where we can go eat so that I can I can just walk out here and you say here’s where we’re going to eat today obviously nobody can do that so but the truth of the matter is is that there are so many decisions if you really stop to count the decisions that you make every day of your life you would be shocked to know how many decisions you make there’s just there’s there’s so many expectations that you that you and I feel like we have to meet there’s calls that have to be returned or you have to make the decision not to return the calls there’s there is request that you have to fulfill there are emails that you have to answer or you don’t answer and there are there are social media inbox messages so and then if that’s not enough on Instagram then you got to go to Facebook and they’ve got inboxes and we got so many boxes we’re about to be boxed in is what we’re about to be we’ve got friend requests that we should answer we’ve got and then when we go home and sit down and turn the TV on we have too many channels to choose from I just just overwhelmed I’m like when I was a kid we had three channels abies CBS and NBC that was it and they went off at two o’clock in the morning but they like that today and now we got so many things and then when you do decide to go somewhere to eat some of these restaurants there the menus are so complicated you just want to shut it like don’t even go to the Cheesecake Factory I’m just telling you never go there when you’re tired and when you’re really hungry because you’re just like what what is all of this right here you know I I got tickle s yesterday because I was reading a story about this woman who said that she she said I moved into a new apartment and I was glad to begin there and that by the time I’m getting everything unloaded unpacked I realized I don’t have a toilet brush for the bathroom so she said I went to Amazon and I started looking for a toilet brush she said do you know they sell on Amazon they sell 1161 different kinds of taller brushes now imagine that she said after about an hour of comparing the brushes and comparing the price difference in the brushes and reading all the conflicting reviews that came with all of the brushes she said I finally just got up got dressed I jumped in my car I drove to the local dollar store I walked in and I bought the only brand of toilet brushes that they sold there’s so many options and the more that our options increase our level of certainty about our choices begins to decrease because when you you make a choice you say okay I’m gonna use this I’m gonna take that and but because you have so many options you’re like I don’t know I I don’t know if that’s what I should do or if I should and the next thing you know you’re just consumed she said I wasted an hour just looking at all the reviews and the prices and comparing and I just wanted to toll it rush nobody was gonna see if it was just a toilet brush I mean it’s crazy the options that are out there today have you went to the coffee aisle in the grocery store Lee I mean if you’re a if you’re a newcomer to coffee you are gonna be confused as I don’t know what because there are so many options that are in how about toothpastes have you ever looked at how many options we have with toothpaste listen I just want spearmint I want peppermint all right I just want gel I want pace listen why do I have to go through all of that stuff just give me something that will help me and help people that come in contact with me and God forbid that you ever get a cold because if you ever have to go to the medicine aisle listen you go to the medicine aisle they say do you want something for runny eyes or do you want something for runny nose do you flu symptoms or do you have a cold is your ears burning or are they tingling or are they ringing is this your sinuses or is this your allergies or do you want non-drowsy or drowsy do you want 12 hours or do you want 24 hours what do you want I want you to go away that’s what I want seriously it can be totally overwhelming I mean I used to think Baskin Robbins 31 flavors was overwhelming it’s a breeze now when I was a kid I thought it was overwhelming because as I grew up we only had chocolate or vanilla and occasionally we would have Neapolitan does anybody know any apologies all my old folks they know what that is that’s that’s that’s when you get all three vanilla chocolate and strawberry so those are fun things that we can laugh about it comes to being overwhelmed but there are some serious things today that are overwhelming people people are overwhelmed by their debt it seems like just it’s just overwhelming the way especially if you have credit card debt how it can just the compound interest and god forbid that we would ever oh that I rs anything because they’re gonna get compound interest they’re gonna get penalties they’re gonna get all of that stuff people are overwhelmed student loans they they are there they’re overwhelmed by child care costs like I have to have a family I want to have a family but I make it costs me just as much to put them in in daycare as it does I feel sorry for kids today people today I didn’t have all those options when when my kids were coming up and but to think about it today it gets overwhelming people get overwhelmed by health care costs like do I do I do I do I pay for my medicine or do I repair the roof that’s over my head you know it’s just it gets overwhelming and then and then yours there’s your workload you’ve got to work and you got this load and just as soon as you think you have got your desk pretty much cleared off here comes about a truckload of other things and next thing you know it’s out of control people are overwhelmed by regret they’ve been through stuff then it’s it and they’ve got so much regret that it just stays present and forefront in their minds they’re over there overloaded by shame they’re overloaded by guilt they’re overloaded by worry and by fear some people are overloaded by the by the lack of security they want to be and want to have more security overwhelmed by pain overwhelmed by loss overwhelmed by anger overwhelmed by by grief overwhelmed by resentment and bitterness overwhelmed by the conflict between you and your kids or if everything’s good between you and your kids it’s between your kids and your kids and it’s just so much so so much as it’s causing us to be overwhelmed should we stay here should we move should we do this should we do that it’s it’s it can be absolutely overwhelmed it if you weren’t overwhelmed when I got up you’re overwhelmed right now overwhelmed in our families overwhelmed in our marriages we’re living in the same house but we’re also living in two different worlds it can be overwhelming what do you do when you find yourself overwhelmed and so today that’s that’s what I want to talk about in the man that’s gonna help me talk about that is that I I really like him he’s a cool guy his name is Josh AFET I mean listen a name like that is overwhelming can you imagine can you imagine when you go to kindergarten please spell your name spell jaws how many syllables in my name that’s overwhelming can you imagine what he what he felt like when he had to write and imagine his nickname think about that people that didn’t want to call him Joe ha stuff that they probably just called him Jay fat or fat you know it’s just that’s overwhelming in and of itself hello can Jay fat come out and play today it’s crazy but I really like Jehoshaphat I like him because he’s a good guy he was a good King and he is a really good leader he had a strange name and I don’t know why his mother did that but anyway I hope you’re naming jaha’s have had him here today just come down here right now I’m gonna pray for you so the Bible tells us that that he was a great leader he led the entire nation of Israel into a revival it was it was just a reviving that he brought death to them and in second chronicles 19 and 4 the Bible says that King Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and he went among the people from bear Sheva to the mountains of Ephraim and he brought them back to the Lord God of their fathers he went to all of the little cities he didn’t just go to the big cities he went to all the little cities he went to where the real people lived and he got down with him and he hung out with him and by doing this he caused them to turn their hearts back to God you would be amazed to know just how far it how far reaching your willingness to come to where people are what would really go it could possibly cause them to turn their hearts back to God and so because of his efforts that he was a great success and there was a great spiritual awakening that came to Israel it was really he and the spiritual awakening was very good for the nation of Israel however we all know that that good is often going to be followed by something bad if we can just be honest today it’s a good time but you can’t hardly enjoy the good time for fear of what the bad time is going to bring we know that for every mountaintop you can always expect that there will be a valley we know that with every high somewhere there’s going to be a low we know that with every setup there’s probably somebody waiting in the wings to set you back it’s just life it’s it’s it’s how it’s it’s how it is there’s always the day after the wedding everybody looks forward to the wedding it’s exciting you build to order but then there’s the day after when it’s all over if there’s the day after Christmas we’re excited about Christmas but then you wake up the next day after Christmas and your kids are already bored and you don’t spend a thousand dollars on a little toys and they look at you and say can we go to Chuck E Cheese you know it’s it’s the day after the Super Bowl party everybody’s excited on the day but then there’s the day you wake up and it’s over how about the New Year’s Eve party everybody’s excited New Year’s Eve it’s all changing we’re getting everything behind us hallelujah but then you wake up in is January 1st and we’re just back to our routine so on a personal note I I have noticed that on the heels of most every one of my life’s greatest blessings or greatest achievements or greatest victories or one of my life’s greatest testimonies right on the heel heels of that there will always come a test anybody ever noticed that it’s just you no sooner get through celebrating till you realize oh shoot I’m in the middle of another test and this this particular happens it particularly happens when we make a fresh commitment to God anybody ever made a fresh commitment to God you’re in church on Sunday and you’re excited tears are rolling down your face you feel God you’re like God I’m gonna be I’m gonna change my life bringing my life into alignment with you I’m getting my house in order Cod I’m gonna get it all together and and next thing you know here comes a test without fail that happens and and sometimes the test comes through people that you love because not everybody is happy about your commitment to Christ and somebody is going to challenge your decision the enemy’s going to always make sure that somebody is there to challenge your decision somebody is gonna be angry because you have made up in your mind I’ve changed uniforms today I’ve changed sides I’ve changed ugly gence as I am in the Lord’s army today somebody is going to be upset at that upset about that because anytime you are the friend of God you are the enemy of Satan it just happens to work like that and and so that’s that’s what happens here that’s what was happening here in second chronicles chapter 20 and verse 1 it says in the King James or in the New King James it says after this after this after what after after the spiritual awakening happened that I just told you about after this the armies of the Moabites the ammonites and some of the Mia Knights declared war on Jehoshaphat of course they did because we just come through a great celebration so he is the king of a small country called Israel and three of his his enemies that get together and they decide that they’re going to gang up on him you ever felt like the life just ganged up on you maybe I’m preaching to the wrong Church by I’m gonna find somebody else to preach this to cuz they’ll get it I said do you ever feel like life just has ganged up on you so then the Bible says then then some messengers came and they told you Hoss effete in an inner that a great multitude or a huge combined army is coming against you and they’re coming from the Dead Sea and Jehoshaphat starts feeling overwhelmed because his enemies are ganging up on him and and I and I know it that’s that’s like sometimes you feel like I don’t know where you’ve been hit on the right and then as soon as you’re like pulling yourself together from that here comes something out on the left and and you’re being hit on every side by by the enemy and it seems like everything was going right but now it’s all going wrong at the same time anybody know what I’m talking about anybody had a week like that so that’s what King Jehoshaphat was feeling and things were going good the nation was was in revival all of a sudden he hears that the three armies of his enemies have United together and they are on their way to destroy him so now he’s facing a triple threat and he did just to be honest he’s a king but he is overwhelmed the Bible says that shaken Jay said yeah that’s what I’m gonna call him Jay fat said himself to seek the Lord he’s overwhelmed he’s scared and he’s shaken but look what he does he sets himself to seek the Lord he went to God for help and he also ordered that the entire nation make a sacrifice and begin a fast now there’s a lesson right there in that all by itself wouldn’t you feel overwhelmed by a problem do not let that problem intimidate you but make it motivate you to pray more okay why why should I be intimidated when I can be motivated look at somebody and say don’t be intimidated be motivated I’m overwhelmed but at the same time I’m more motivated to seek God in prayer I’m motivated to trust him more I’m motivated to believe more I’m motivated to depend and lean upon him more I’m overwhelmed but I’m also expecting more so you won’t either do one of the other you’ll be intimidated and you’ll back up or you’ll say oh right and you’ll become motivated and you’ll get yourself ready for whatever you have to get yourself ready so the first thing that Joseph had does is he makes it a matter of personal prayer the second thing that he does is he gets not only himself but he tells the whole nation around him to pray I want you to look at your neighbor and say neighbor I dare you to pray about it now look at that same neighbor and say back to their neighbor I dare you to pray about it see well what I want to pull from this story today there are five things that I’m gonna give you that Jehoshaphat did when he felt overwhelmed so if you are in this place get your iPad get pin get something out because I’m gonna give you something to take home with you today because I want you to put this in practice every time that you feel as if you are overwhelmed and and you know what if you don’t feel like you’re overwhelmed today take this down anyway cuz one of these days you’re gonna wake up and see where is that message pastor Brady was preaching about being overwhelmed so I want you to write this down what do you do when you’re overwhelmed the first thing that Jay fat did what he did I person said it the first thing that Jehoshaphat did when he let me say it like this there are five things he did and they worked for him and I would almost stake my life on it today that what I’m getting ready to tell you if that they work for him but they’re gonna work for you too I’m telling you I’m convinced up there there are five thinks the first thing that there are five right moves that he made when he was overwhelmed when you’re overwhelmed you can’t afford to make a wrong move so I need you to write this down the five write loses one of the first write moves he made was he turned to God write that down the first right move he made was he turned to God he didn’t turn to friends he didn’t turn to his military capabilities he didn’t turn to his weapons he didn’t turn to human reasoning he didn’t turn to social media to take it out on social media he didn’t turn to to rant to anybody he didn’t turn to his followers he didn’t start developing a plan there’s nothing wrong with the plan everybody needs a plan but before you develop a plan you need to pray and as you pray God will give you his plan and not your plan okay so you’ve got to turn to prayer before you turn to your plan prayer should be our first choice and not our last resort I said prayer should be our first choice and not our last resort oftentimes we wait till we get to the point where prayer is the last thing that we can do we’ve all heard people say well all we can do now is just you’re heard somebody say that before all we can do now is just pray we’ve done tried everything we know and so all we’re gonna do right now is we’re just gonna put it in the hands of God and we’re going to pray no we should have prayed before you ever done anything else prayer should have been our first choice and not our last resort I’m so most say until somebody hears it today God is saying you’re not praying to me you’re asking everybody else you’re trying to work it in your head you’re trying to figure out how you can do it you’re trying to make your next move and God said stop a minute and talk to me about it you should go straight to God and say God I got trouble coming from everywhere I’ve got financial trouble I’ve got to help him tails issues I got family trouble I got emotional trouble Lord I’m spiritually in trouble and I need your help somebody said I need your help that’s what Jay Joseph had did Jehoshaphat said not only am I gonna pray about it he said but I’m gonna get this entire nation to pray he said the country in in verse 4 in the message he says the country of Judah United in seeking God’s help they came from all of the cities of Judah to pray to God see once it gets the whole nation to pray once it gets gets everybody all the national leaders to come together and pray then he opens up his mouth okay first he’s just praying to God second he gets everybody else in there to pray with him but then when everybody gets there he publicly opens his mouth and he starts calling on the name of the Lord sometimes you can’t just pray in your head and you can’t just bring in your heart sometimes you got to open your mouth and let everybody around you hear you call on God sometimes he wants to hear your voice and then good enough for me to pray for you some situations you got to pray for yourself he did that that’s leadership right there that’s amazing leadership right there if we could get some of our political people our spiritual people our social leaders our local leaders our national leaders to come together and pray to lay aside denomination and pray just set aside our differences and pray to put our logos and our egos in the floor and just begin to pray I believe that we would hear from heaven did somebody say man right there cuz there’s no problem that is too big and there is no problem that is too small for us to pray about if it’s big enough for you to worry about it’s big enough for you to pray about hallelujah so I want to teach you exactly how he prayed because I believe that if you’ll apply this to your life when you’re overwhelmed let’s go work for you too so so what did I say the first thing he did was he turned to God for help okay and then in verses all the way down from verses 6 to verses 12 he asks God for questions he asks are you not do you not is there not will you not each one of those requests was a way of praying to God because of of heat because of the fact that he was under attack so the first thing he said that the Bible says he did he turned to God in prayer the second thing that he did was he focused on God and not the problem now hear me I know that’s going right over your head today and you’re adding think about going in one ear and out the other but I dare you to apply this to your life he’s focused on God and not his problem have you have you have you asked anybody the question like have you ever just looked and say hey how are you doing and their answer is B will be like well under the circumstances I’m doing okay well number one why are you under the circumstance you need be on top of the circumstances okay not on dirt but on top all right circumstances are like a mattress if you get on top of it you’ll rest if you get underneath it you’re gonna suffocate tell somebody to get on top get on top so when you need when you pray you need to turn your focus off of the problem and turn your focus on to the solution turn your focus on to God and if you continue here’s why because if you continue to look at the negative if you continue to focus on the problem where the focus goes the power flows and what was little becomes big big big big and bigger so if you focus on the lack the black is gonna get bigger if you focus on the problem the problem will get bigger if you focus on the negative all the negativity is going to get bigger and you will continue to feel overwhelmed so Jehoshaphat made the decision in prayer and he asked it for ways I told him to put I got my notes y’all gotta up up under number two I want you to write a B C and D here’s the four ways he did it when he began to pray the Bible said he remembered how big God was he remembered how big God was the bigger you realize how you’re God the bigger that you recognize how big your God is the smaller your your problem is going to become your problem is going to shrink when God expands in your life do you understand that when God gets big the problem gets small so you me and here’s why because he is all-powerful he is always in control he is all-knowing there is nothing that is too hard for him and with God all things are possible so he said in verse 6 are you not God in heaven this is how this man is praying are you not God in heaven do you not rule over the kingdoms of the nations and is your hand and in your hand is there not power and is there not mine so that no one is able to withstand you when’s the last time you went to God like that he called God out that’s exactly what he did he’s saying yeah I’ve got some problems but I know this I know that you are bigger than my problems so he remembered how big God was second thing he did is he remembered what God had done in the past well write that down you gotta remember what God has done in the past he said I realized that I’ve been in tough times and tight places before but I also know that I’m still here I know that I have survived them I know that I have come through them I know that I have outlasted them I know that I have outlived them because I know and whom I have believed and I and persuaded that he was able and if that God did it from me then the same God that did it for me then is gonna do it for me right now look at somebody say he’ll do it again so he said in verse 7 he says Oh God did you not drive out those who lived in this land before you brought your people Israel here he’s reminding God you did this before he’s saying hey aren’t you the one that brought us here we didn’t even come here ourselves we didn’t ask to be here you’re the one that established us you brought us in and you brought us in through Abraham and then we went down into Egypt and we got enslaved for 400 years and when Moses brought us back did you not take care of those enemies for us then and now they’re trying to return and here we are trying to get in our homeland and you took care of them you wiped them out from us and now God here they come again he says you took care of them back then and you took care of them in my past you won’t take care of them in my future do you hear the confidence he’s saying I know who you are and I know what you’re able to do if you don’t know that in your belly then you’ll never get anywhere in God but you at some point you’ve got to say I know you are and I know what kind of power you had you need to remind yourself when you are feeling overwhelmed that one God is a big card and number two if he helped you before he will help you again and then I love how he starts recollecting this in verse 9 he said you helped us when we face disasters you were there for us when we were in wars you there went disease hit us you were there when we were facing famine he said I remember how big you are I remember what you have done and here’s the third one I remember what you promised well look at your neighbor and say neighbor you got to know what he’s promised there are 7,000 promises in the Word of God and a sure sign that you don’t know what God has promised to you is the fact that you worry you can’t worry and believe his promise at the same get somebody tell him I believe God I believe God Jehoshaphat said God I know how I know you’re big I know what you’ve done and I also know what you promised does anybody know what God has promised you he said I know what you promised and because of that he said I’m up staying on your promise did he did you not give this land to your friend Abraham and to his descendants and did you not give it to us forever you did not put a time frame on this you said this was ours forever didn’t you promise this property to us did you say this was our land didn’t you say this was our parking lot did you say this was our church didn’t you say this was my house did you call it the promised land on purpose so I want to know how you gonna keep your word God are you gonna let these three enemies come in and try to wipe us out he’s overwhelmed but his confidence is coming back I can hear it he said I remember how big you are I remember what you’ve done and I remember what you promised fourth thing he said I remember your character he said I know what kind of God you are I know that you’re a good god I know that you’re a faithful God I know that you’re a loving God I know that you’re a fair God I know that you’re an honest God I know that you are just and I know that you are even-handed so here let me really quick in one minute give you just a little backdrop to this story for hundreds of years earlier when Moses got the Jews out of slavery and started brought them back to the promised land there were three tribes that had already moved in while Israel had been enslaved three tribes and their names were the Amorite the Moabites and the me unites and God specifically told the Jews as he was bringing them in don’t worry about them don’t fight them let them live right there leave them alone let them stay where they are he said I don’t want you to fight them I don’t want you to wipe them out I don’t want you to get into this battle because this battle is not yours just leave them on the right side of the Jordan so now you’re up to date a hundred years later there are three tribes and now they are uniting together attempting to try to destroy Israel are you kidding me we could have wiped you out when we came back but we let you live their wing charge you no rent we you stay right where you were we were obeyed God we could have killed you but we’ll let you live and now you gonna get together and act like you don’t kill us you are kidding me so you know it’s awesome that does he immediately goes to appealing to the character of God and he does it in verse 10 in verse 12 and he said look here you didn’t let us touch them when we got here at first we detoured around them we did not lay a hand on them and now they have come to kick us out of the country God that you gave us oh dear God won’t you take care of them we are helpless before these vandal hordes ready to attack us we don’t know what to do we are looking unto you so do you see what Jehoshaphat is doing right there he’s saying God I don’t know how to fix it but I’m turning to you I’m overwhelmed I don’t have the answers there is no way I am going into battle because the odds are against us it’s three armies two one if I take our armies in there their army in there that we are going to lose so I’m turning to you and I’m choosing to focus on you and I’m gonna focus on the problem promise and not the problem but but he said in doing so I’m gonna remind you number one how big you are you’re all-powerful you’re all knowing you’re all able you’re capable number two I’m gonna remind you what you’ve done for me in the past you’ve been there before you helped us out of tighter places than this I’m gonna remind you number three what you promised us about our future I’m calling you out on the gaudy then you said it or you didn’t either you gonna do it or you’re not going to it and I’m asking you God keep your word keep your word to my family keep your word to my household keep your word keep your promise to me and number four he said I’m I’m gonna ask you to fulfill your character I’m gonna asked you to be who you are well okay so y’all got that all that is up under number two I ain’t got time to wait I gotta keep moving so the thing that Jehoshaphat did that was right that you got to do what I got to do that’s right his number one he turned to God for help number two he focused on God and not the problem the third thing that he did that was right he admitted his inability he admitted his inability the first step toward victory in any area of your life is to come out of denial and admit that you can’t fix this I can’t do it on my own I can’t get out of debt on my own I cannot find a job on my own I cannot pay back these school loans on my own I can’t raise these kids on my own I cannot face retirement on my own I’m overwhelmed and I am admitting to you my in abilities that’s what that goes all the way back to that thing that gives you grace when you come before God and say I’m gonna tell you people think I got it together but the truth is I ain’t got it together I can’t fix it if you don’t help me if you don’t fix it it’s not going to be fixed he said we are helpless and we don’t know what to do what is he saying right there he’s saying we don’t have the power and we don’t have the knowledge oh it’s hard to admit that you don’t have the power and you don’t have the knowledge you are the king you’re that king of your world and you find it hard to go to God and say look I’m powerless I’m helpless and I don’t know how to do this and I love what the next verse says he said now all of Judah this was the real men with their little ones who with their wife’s so they weren’t ashamed they didn’t have these milli goes okay cuz they knew what they were in trouble they let their wives and their children see them calling on the name of Jesus they stood before God together and the wives just didn’t wait on the husband’s the wife’s began to pray out to God cover our house cover our family cover our children why because if one of us can put a thousand to flight two of us can put ten thousands of flight and the Bible said that the whole Potter’s House Lord I mean the whole nation started calling on the name of the Lord what do you do when you’re overwhelmed hit somebody and tell them get honest before God my marriage looks like an angle make it God this dream looks like you will never come to pass the plans that I have are all jacked up I need you to help me if you don’t help me I’ll never get a harvest if you don’t help me I’m not gonna make it so what do you do when you’re overwhelmed you pour your heart out you poor young nuts out and you surrender everything to God you turn it over to him and you trust him and when you do here’s how God responds he said in the fifteenth verse he said listen all of you are Judah you inhabitants of Jerusalem and you took King Jason thus says the Lord to you don’t be afraid but that it happened till he got honest that didn’t happen until he was got honest privately and he got honest publicly it’s sad when your title won’t let you access the help that’s right in your house in your home in your business and your family because you got to keep being who you are defeat it at all but when he cried when he gathered people around him that have the same heart the same mind the same vision the voice of the Lord begin to speak do not be afraid don’t be dismayed because of this great multitude why why why are you telling me that because this battle is not yours this battle is God well listen to me I’m your pastor I love you I want your marriage to make it I want your children to make it I want you to make it I want you to get out of debt I want you to get to where you can live comfortably in God but I’m gonna tell you the truth and I can tell you because I know what I’m talking about the reason that were stressed out the reason that we’re exhausted the reason that our marriages are falling apart the reason that we’re weary in well-doing the reason that were checked out the reason that were wore out the reason that were burned out is because we are trying to fight battles that are not ours to fight you’ve got a discern what is your battle and what is the Lord’s you don’t have the energy you don’t have the knowledge you don’t have the power and the reason that we’re feeling frantic about all of this stuff is because we’re trying to be God we are not God God is God I said God is God God is saying did I ever ask you Jos a pet to fight these three armies Oh No haven’t I always taken care of you yeah you’ve always taken care of us haven’t I made some promises to you well I don’t know who I am talking to today and who God brought me here to preach to but I came to tell somebody that God brought me here to tell you that this battle is not yours this battle is the Lord’s this problem is not your yell that big thing that’s in your face right now God said that thing right there this ain’t your battled this ain’t your problem this is not your situation it’s not yours to fix it is God’s to fix and if you stop trying to fix what God has not called you to fix then you will stop being a failure because you’re in over your head and God said I want you to humble yourself I’m wanting you to swallow your pride and I’m wanting you to invite me into your struggle but we keep failing oh god I’m such a failure I messed up I’m so sorry hold up you did not let me down cuz you never held me up to begin with I won’t tell you that right now oh you ain’t that powerful see some of us you have you ever have you ever have you ever sat on a plane and you know it’s getting ready to run down it’s going down the runways getting ready to take off have you ever just started flapping your wings like it was your responsibility for that plane to take off some of you are exhausted right now because you’re walking around flapping your rings trying to get your dream off the ground trying to get your business off the ground trying to get your relationships off the ground you’ve been flapping so hard and you have been doing so long that now you’re about to give up you’re about to throw in the towel you’re about to quit hello and God is saying right back to you uh listen go ahead quit in whatever you know whatever you need to do he said it’s about time it’s about time you give up because that is not the strategy I gave you the strategy I gave you is something different and if you start trying to make it happen and just let it happen you will find out that you got some jet engines attached to you and those jet engines will do all the lifting tell somebody let God do the heavy lifting you’re slapping and all you’re flapping in the world is never going to be enough come on somebody repeat this with me God is God and I’m not God is God and I’m not close your eyes and say it God is God and I I am NOT God the Sun in verse 17 you will not need to fight in this battle look at somebody and tell him it ain’t your battle position yourself he said you ain’t gonna have to fight but this is what you’re gonna have to do position yourself stand still but stand still and see us you know what salvation means the complete deliverance spirit soul and body stand still and see the salvation of the Lord who is with you old Judah is with you all Jerusalem and that happened Jeff had bowed his head and with his face to the ground and all Judah and all of the inhabitants of Jerusalem they bow down before the Lord and they started worshiping the Lord he’s saying boy you can worry or you can worship you can panic or you can praise you can run or you can rest and sometimes it takes more courage to do nothing than it does to do something be stale rest relax and stand firm here’s the fourth thing I got a stop for a thing that he did what was right he thanked God in advance but verse 21 after talking it over with the people Jehoshaphat appointed aquire for God so he’s like ok just say not battle but this is our opportunity to worship I want you to sing and I want you to sing and I want you to say and the Bible said that he he we dressed them in holy robes they even had they even had choir robes Thank You Hafsah fans today and he said I’m dressed him in holy robes and they were to march ahead of the troops and they were to sing and to give thanks to God because his love endure it forever so you got the army back here and you got the choir out there that’s Judah out there and you got the fighter back here look at somebody say sends you the first since universe send you Bray’s out first that’s what he was doing he was sent the praises out in advance and oh hear me today Church and when you start to thanking God in advance for miracles I’m telling you God tells miraculous sometimes we gotta stand still and say thank you sometimes we gotta stand there and when we want to move we gotta resist the urge to move and say nobody it’s my job just to say thank you and the Bible said as in verse 22 as soon as they started praising and shouting to God somebody say at that moment at that moment if you were smart you would be like oh god I just thank you right now that moment God sets ambushment against the men of Amnon against Moe who did it who did it they didn’t have to do it God did it and as they were as they sang the men of Amnon of Moab and Mount Sierra as they were attacking Judah they started attacking Judah they started attacking the praises and next thing you know God got involved and all of them ended up dead can y’all pull it up can y’all pull up verse 24 verse 24 pull it up on the screen so it saved me a minute’s time verse 24 hello okay so when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness they looked toward the multitude and they were dead bodies these are the people that were coming after us keep it going keep it going there were dead bodies they had fallen on the earth and no one had escaped keep going and when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil they found among them an abundance of valuables on the dead bodies did somebody say I’m going in for the kill I’m going in for the kill there was precious jewellery which they stripped off for themselves more than they could even carry away and they were that for three days you’re alone three days three days they were saya three days just gathering up the spoil and they did that because there was so much keep going keep going and on the fourth day they assembled in the valley of Baraka for their they bless the Lord I bet you better bless the Lord therefore the name of that place was called the valley of Baraka until this day keep it going and then they returned every man of Judah and Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat in front of them so it was Judah in front of them now Jehoshaphat is there he said Jehoshaphat said to them go back to Jerusalem and boy y’all better go back with joy I’m telling somebody in this place when you go home today you better go back with joy why why because the law I had made them rejoice over their enemies keep going so they came to Jerusalem and they got strained instruments they got harps they got trumpets and they took it to the house of the Lord and the fear of God was on all the kingdoms I bet there was the kingdoms whose countries when they heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel keep going then the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet why in other words all of his enemies shut up because God I don’t I don’t know for in the message version because I think mine reads a little bit different but all of his enemies shut down why cuz they heard about how not how they fought they’re better yeah see people might be a match for you they’re not a match for your God here’s the fifth one and I gotta stop here’s the fifth thing that he did that was right that you gotta do he discovered the blessing in the middle of the bed one of the things that happens when you stop flapping your wings and you stop trying to make things happen and you stop pretending like you are God and like you are so in control of your own life as you get blessed beyond measure God took them from the valley of the battle over to the valley of baracan that means the valley of blessing from the valley of the battle to the valley of the blessing God wants to give you so much that you have to share it with other people just imagine that just imagine that for a minute don’t let that go over your head Ino out your ear can you imagine God flipping the script in your life in a 24-hour period I’ve read you the Bible today I this is not my story this is God’s story this is what I’m telling you he flipped that script they got the prophetic word they went to sleep they got some rest then they got up and they got the victory they went from being overwhelmed by the burden to overloaded by the blessing and let me tell you somethin verse 27 can you pull up verse 27 for me in verse 27 the Bible said they were then they returned every man of Judah and Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat in front of them to go back to Jerusalem with joy for the Lord had made them rejoice over their enemies in other words it wasn’t they themselves who got the victory this was hand given to them God did this for them you know there are some battles that when you win you’re so exhausted from the fight because there is a fight that I’m not to fight right out of you there’s some battle you win but you’re like I need time to recover before I can enjoy what I want not this time they got the spoils they went back home rejoicing what was the difference this battle was the Lord’s they didn’t earn it they didn’t fight for it they didn’t beg for it they didn’t buy it all they did was just receive it because when you do those five things y’all got all of them can we put them up just put them up on the screen real quick one two three four five one two three pray about it thank you he focused on God and not the problem he admitted his inability he thanked God in advance and he discovered the blessing in the bad y’all got that come on jump up on your feet all over the building just look at somebody and tell him I’m going after the blessing I’m going after the blessing I’ve had some tough times I’ve been in some tight places but it’s getting rid of shifts because I’m getting a focus on God I’m get rid of call on God and not my neighbor not my friend not my buddy not my mama not I put my daddy I’m getting a call out God and I’m gonna look at bad things and I’m most searched until I find the good things there were dead bodies everywhere they climbed over the bad days and they got the rings off that finger and they got the jewelry off their neck are y’all here at me be careful that you don’t throw away the bad cuz your blessing might be right in the middle of it and sometimes you gotta be willing to say hmm this is a little weird but give me what belongs to me this is mine hear this I got a stop here this right here they didn’t come after the enemy when they got back to their land and realized they had been inhabiting that place God said don’t touch him because there’s a time there’s a time frame be careful what you try to uproot outside of the timing of God hello don’t stir up the devil if you can’t cast him out all that means is you gotta get before God and you got to hear him more clearly but if you will all this overwhelm stuff I want every person that’s been feeling overwhelmed to lift both of your hands right now in this building Father in the name of Jesus I see hands all over this building today I believe that we’ve given you our people this word we’re gonna stand on your word if it worked for Jehoshaphat if it works for Judah it’s gonna work for our us if it worked for their house it’s gonna work for our house so Lord today we just surrender everything to you Lord we lay it all down right here in this room we asked you God for help we admit that we can do it by ourselves we absolutely

But RPM/Kent retained many unreleased King masters, and over the years the company released them, thus forcing King to compete with himself.  The most successful of these releases was 'Rock Me Baby,' a blues King wrote with Joe Josea and recorded in about 1958.  The lyric is a basic plea for sex -- 'Rock me all night long' -- while the music provides a blues structure that allows King room for biting guitar work.  'Rock Me Baby' was released as a single on Kent in the spring of 1964 and climbed into the Top 20 of the R&B charts and the Top 40 of the pop charts, making it King's biggest crossover hit yet and his most successful pop record until the appearance of 'The Thrill Is Gone' five and a half years later.  That exposure helped the song become a blues standard, one that was played by many guitarists.  Probably the most radical restatement of 'Rock Me Baby' occurred on June 18, 1967, when the Jimi Hendrix Experience played it at the Monterey International Pop Festival.",Tell me about some of the wonders in Asia,train,"[[0.8165594339370728, 0.18344058096408844], [0.6924694776535034, 0.3075304925441742], [0.4457536041736603, 0.5542463064193726], [0.9499121904373169, 0.05008779466152191], [0.9520264863967896, 0.047973498702049255], [0.9374534487724304, 0.06254657357931137], [0.9442698359489441, 0.05573013424873352], [0.9391392469406128, 0.060860779136419296]]","[[0.9195898771286011, -0.5736189484596252], [0.609467625617981, -0.2022222876548767], [-0.00580154825001955, 0.21204125881195068], [1.6185251474380493, -1.3240669965744019], [1.630595326423645, -1.3573487997055054], [1.4950599670410156, -1.212195634841919], [1.5596576929092407, -1.2702332735061646], [1.512434482574463, -1.2239404916763306]]",0.5542463064193726,0.16530202003195882

The sea is full of colour and life - there are over 1500 species of fish, 400 species of coral and 250 species of birds.  Various species of whales enter the region for courtship, mating, birthing and calf-rearing activities, and can be seen from June until late October.

Both the art and architecture from the Islamic world feature vibrant colours and intricate, geometric patterns; much like the kaleidoscopic patterns one can see during a psychedelic experience, either with eyes opened or closed.  During psychedelic experiences, people may report seeing arabesques, which are a fundamental aspect of Islamic art and consist of rhythmic linear patterns of interlacing foliage and spiralling stems.  An arabesque is usually a single design – featuring plant motifs – that is tessellated (or tiled).  Tessellation is when a surface is covered with geometric shapes that fit together in a pattern with no overlaps or gaps.  Some users of DMT have said that the ceilings of world-renowned mosques (such as the Jalil Khayat Mosque in Iraq) bear a striking resemblance to their DMT visions.

Ancient Rocks of Grand Canyon Most rocks in Grand Canyon are sedimentary rocks, which form when sediments such as sand, silt, or mud gather in thick layers that, over time, are compressed into rock.  Grand Canyon’s sedimentary rock layers accumulated over millions of years on the prehistoric surface of northern Arizona, which has been home to giant sand dunes, muddy river deltas, and shallow tropical seas over the past 500 million years.  These environments formed as ancient continents drifted across the globe and ancient oceans advanced and retreated over those continents.  Eventually, eroded sediments from each of these environments formed distinct layers of sedimentary rocks.  Sand dunes were cemented into sandstone, mud was compressed into shale, and the discarded shells of marine animals were cemented together into limestone.  Because Grand Canyon’s rocks were laid down chronologically, one on top of another, they reflect a geological relationship known as superposition.

New River Gorge in West Virginia The New River Gorge in West Virginia is known as much for its bridge and the crazy people who jump off of it as it is for the depths of beauty as the New River carves the deepest and longest canyon in the Appalachian Mountains.  More than 50 miles of the river are protected as a National River, thus making for pristine hiking, rafting and fishing.  But admittedly, as many people are in awe of the man-made wonders as they are the natural wonders.  The New River Gorge Bridge, completed in 1977, is one of the highest bridges in the world at more than 875 feet above the river.  Each October, the bridge is closed to vehicular traffic for a festival that includes base jumping from the bridge.  With all of these beautiful canyons, the idea is to get out and explore, get up close and personal with the powerful rivers and the earths natural architecture.  But do so with caution.

The Hoyas I get.  But Duke?  Unless my fan radar has gone the way of Alex Ovechkin’s reputation, Duke remains slightly less popular than stink bugs and Ginkgo trees in this town.  If there were any question that the stamp of Dukedom is everlasting, Wednesday night’s Wizards game should have ended it.  The Wizards were cruising to a win, with a late-game double-digit lead.  The crowd was intimate, the result largely insignificant, the drama negligible.  But then arose a mighty cry from near and wide: “J.J. Sucks!  J.J. Sucks!  J.J. Sucks!”  This chant, perfectly audible on television, had nothing to do with the Milwaukee Bucks.  It had everything to do with Duke.  “And the fans here expressing their appreciation to J.J. Redick,” Steve Buckhantz observed.  “That’s really something else,” Phil Chenier said with a jolly chuckle.  The fourth-best free-throw shooter in the NBA missed his first attempt.  Fans rejoiced.

Name Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo dancing There is a long history of enthusiastic speculation on the name's origin or derivation.  One of the most prominent suggestions concerns Caliban being an anagram of the Spanish word caníbal ( Carib people ), the source of cannibal in English.  The character may be seen as a satire on 'Noble cannibal' from Montaigne's Essays (A.30, 'Of Cannibals').  Also popular has been comparison to kaliban or cauliban in the Romani language, which mean black or with blackness.  The first Romanichal had arrived in England a century before Shakespeare's time.

Today, it is known as Tadcaster, located in the English county of North Yorkshire.   The Romans founded the settlement and named it 'Calcaria' from the Latin word for 'lime kilns', reflecting the importance of the area's Magnesian Limestone geology as a natural resource for quarrying.  The nature of the settlement is uncertain.  It is possible that it started as an Imperial staging post with a mansio because of its location at a river crossing on the road from Danum (Doncaster) to Eburacum (York).

Banking Banking can be traced to the colonial era when banks where established by Colonial masters to serve the needs of the Colonial Government at that time.  Shortly before the country gained independent in July 1959, the Central Bank of Nigeria began operations in the country.  Generally, the banking industry in Nigeria is responsible for holding the financial assets of individuals and businesses.  The banks are also involved in investing these assets to generate more revenue.  Although, the banking industry isn’t exactly responsible for the economic development of the country, it plays an effective and important role.  The industry is particularly known for facilitating financial transaction which helps to promote international and local trade.  Agriculture Once upon a time, agriculture in Nigeria was so vibrant that the revenue from this industry was used to sponsor free education.  Between the 1950s and 1970s, cocoa was a major foreign exchange earner for the country and the profit from cocoa was used to fund free education in Western Nigeria.

Fish, cassava, bananas, palm oil, and palm kernels were traded at Calabar for European manufactured goods, and the town also served as a major slave-trading depot.

I just   love fish (especially eating them!).  I   wonder what your favourite food is?  Let me guess… hamburgers?    Ice cream?  Candy bars?  Well that’s probably  more likely than raw carrots or garlic.  So   anyway, what exactly is food?  Let’s look   at what it’s made of.  Food   (which really includes many types of drinks too — like   milk shakes and cola — but not water) is   made up of nutrients.  These are the things which   give you energy or help build up your body as   you grow.  Maybe   you already know what the most important Big Three   nutrients are:  proteins which  you find in meat, fish, beans and stuff    carbohydrates — sugar  is one and you find others in bread,  cereals and vegetables   fat — I  guess you know what that is.  You find it  in fried foods, cheese, butter, margarine  and oils Almost all the food you eat has some of the Big   Three in it.","Well, tell me about Nigerian food.",train,"[[0.94952392578125, 0.05047604441642761], [0.94952392578125, 0.05047604441642761], [0.9662907719612122, 0.03370926156640053], [0.9815688133239746, 0.0184311605989933], [0.374240905046463, 0.6257591247558594], [0.4042088985443115, 0.5957911014556885], [0.9314186573028564, 0.06858134269714355], [0.9019225835800171, 0.09807737916707993], [0.9051575064659119, 0.09484243392944336], [0.876723051071167, 0.12327692657709122], [0.32511693239212036, 0.6748830676078796], [0.9456151723861694, 0.05438479781150818], [0.8947346806526184, 0.10526536405086517], [0.2597337067127228, 0.7402663826942444], [0.9026199579238892, 0.09738004207611084], [0.29942482709884644, 0.7005751132965088], [0.2893242835998535, 0.7106757164001465]]","[[1.6172136068344116, -1.3172482252120972], [1.6172136068344116, -1.3172482252120972], [1.8377121686935425, -1.5179799795150757], [2.1546173095703125, -1.8204920291900635], [-0.1113462746143341, 0.4027194678783417], [-0.055023614317178726, 0.3329346776008606], [1.4471021890640259, -1.161586046218872], [1.2570643424987793, -0.9617075324058533], [1.2758630514144897, -0.9800289273262024], [1.1308250427246094, -0.8309328556060791], [-0.1972442865371704, 0.5331102013587952], [1.566894292831421, -1.2888566255569458], [1.2190905809402466, -0.920952320098877], [-0.3412037491798401, 0.7061495780944824], [1.2538233995437622, -0.9728567600250244], [-0.2449529469013214, 0.6050851941108704], [-0.2645120620727539, 0.6341559886932373]]",0.7402663826942444,0.2848736060892834

But on the other side of the continent, in Senegal, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Nigeria, is a wholly different style of cooking.  In place of injera is doughy fufu, torn and dipped in bowls of okra or cassava-leaf stew.  Stewed goat or whole fish is served atop beds of rice cooked with onion and tomato.  The soup of the day is hot pepper, and the pepper, always, is Scotch bonnet.  The Washington area is home to several West African gems, mostly hidden — in some cases across the street from Ethio­pian competitors.  Unlike many of those East African restaurants, though, these no-frills diners and takeout joints have no lines or wait times — at least, not yet.

1423,1423,19905,140_4-6,0,MARCO_38_286413527-2,0,"When canning tomatoes, The National Center for Home Food Preservation advises that you use no more than 3 cups of vegetables for every 22 lbs of tomatoes. If you add too many vegetables, you dilute the natural acid from the tomatoes, and your soup is no longer able to be canned.  Sticking to this advised ratio, I added most of my flavorings for this soup in the way of dried herbs and spices.  How To Make Tomato Soup For Canning Once you have a good recipe, made for putting in jars, the process is pretty straightforward: cook vegetables until very soft puree the vegetables season the soup reduce the soup can it!  I used a high powered blender to puree our cooked tomatoes and onion.  There were only a few small tomato bits left after blending so I didn’t bother straining my soup.  If you have a blender that doesn’t sufficiently chop up tomato skins, you might want to strain the soup before seasoning and reducing it.  Alternatively, use a food mill to puree the tomatoes and get rid of the skins.  What Tomatoes Should I Use?  The best tomatoes to use are “paste” tomatoes.  These are tomatoes that have thicker, meatier walls and contain less water.","Fair enough.

Soups are great for meal prepping and are often quick and easy to whip up, but most recipes make pretty large batches — so what's the best way to store leftovers?  Freezing soup may seem super easy, but in reality, not all soups can be frozen and there are varying shelf lives depending on your ingredients.  Let us break it down for you.  The best soups to freeze are stews with chunky vegetables, protein, and broth.  These typically hold up well due to the nature of their ingredients — broth doesn't separate or curdle and proteins and vegetables can withstand the moisture well to keep intact.  These soups can last up to three months in the freezer.  What you will want to be wary of is freezing anything with dairy or something cream-based.  These soups can be frozen for one month, tops.","Fair enough.

Having said that, let’s take a closer look at some of the types of Farming that does very well in Nigeria. 1.  Rice Farming Nigeria has one of the world’s highest Rice consumption stat.  Rice is by far one of the most popular staple food among Nigerians.  Almost every family eats rice daily in Nigeria.  In 2011 alone, Nigeria spent N991billion on rice importation and the rice we import is said to be nothing less than 10 years old in storage.  That means we spent billions buying rice that has since lost its nutritional values.  Any entrepreneur who goes into rice farming and get it right is sure to be smiling to the bank.  A bag of rice is currently sold for N13,000 to N16,000 depending on the quality.  A farmer who is able to invest in large scale rice production in Nigeria and able to produce 100,000 Bags of processed Rice in a year, sell at wholesale price of about N10,000 per bag, he will be making 10,000 x 100,000 = N1,000,000,000 ($3million)  You can achieve the above figures conveniently with less than five hundred and fifty million Naira ($1.5 Million) capital investment.",Wow.

It is a variety of the long, thin-grained aromatic rice considered as the most expensive variety of rice in the world.  Basmati is a Hindi word which literally means “fragrant.”  It was the Indian traders who introduced basmati rice to the Middle East.  It is not only an important part of Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi dishes, but is also largely used in Middle Eastern and Persian cuisines as well.  Nowadays, several countries, including the US, would have their own domestically grown crops but these aren’t as good as the basmati rice imported from its native origin.","Nigerian and Ghanaian Jollof are quite different, aren’t they?

Orzo looks like grains of barley and also comes close to looking like larger grains of rice.  Therefore, it is also often called risoni, which means big rice in Italian.  Orzo is not specified to a single region in Italy as it’s is widely used all across the country.

1450,1450,21188,141_1-1,0,MARCO_51_3565148-2,0,"Why a 20% down payment is ideal for lenders Mortgage lenders evaluate your credit profile, your debt-to-income ratio, your job history and your assets to make an educated guess about whether you will manage to repay your loan responsibly. A 20% down payment is viewed as ideal by lenders because you are investing a significant amount of your own money in your home and therefore the lender’s risk is reduced.  If you make a 20% down payment, you won’t have to pay private mortgage insurance.  PMI provides insurance to the lender in case you default on your loan.  Advantages of a 20% down payment for buyers In addition to eliminating the need for PMI, a 20% down payment on a house will qualify you for a slightly lower interest rate than a borrower who makes a smaller down payment.  Another benefit is that you will borrow less money, making your monthly payments smaller.  In addition, you will instantly have 20% equity in your home, which you can borrow against in the future or get back as part of your profit when you sell.  On the other hand, keep in mind that 20% of the average home price in the nation ($200,000) is $40,000.",I’ve got an offer to make 20% monthly interest on my money.

Making a 20% down payment can also help you snag a lower interest rate, thus decreasing your monthly payment and how much you’ll pay in interest over the life of the loan.  Still, there are loan programs that let borrowers make a smaller down payment without incurring PMI, but if you’re going with a conventional loan, 20% is usually ideal.  Evaluate your budget Lenders want reassurance that you’ll be able to make your mortgage payments on time in addition to all of your other financial obligations.  To do this, they determine your debt-to-income ratio.  First, they’ll look at your front-end ratio — your monthly housing payment (including insurance, interest, taxes, and PMI, if applicable) divided by your monthly income.  The general rule of thumb is to keep this at or below 28%.  Next, the lender will look at your back-end ratio, which shows how much of your monthly income goes to service your existing debt (e.g., car loans, student loans, credit card payments).",I’ve got an offer to make 20% monthly interest on my money.

When borrowing money have in mind the interest rate you will have to pay, is it 14 % or less.  It depends on the amount of money you borrow and the credit score you have.  To solve this problem you can improve your credit score for example.  Then apply for as much as you need, do not go for the highest borrow of $35,000.  Because if you take a bigger loan the more interest pay you will have.  Carefully think about do you want a 5 year or a 3 year loan.  If you can afford to pay off the 3 year loan take it because it will lower your interest rate.  If you have recently applied for a credit somewhere that means that your credit score fell down.

The pawn shop will lend an amount equal to a percentage of the item’s value.  Payback windows are short — usually between 30 and 90 days — to pay it back with (oftentimes breathtaking) interest.  Most states have statutes limiting pawnbroker interest rates, although they can range as high as 120% APR.  There are additional problems with add-on fees for service, storage and a lost ticket.  Add-on fees can be more than what you paid in interest charges.  Regardless of any loan, consumers should read the entire agreement, especially the fine print.  You must understand the costs, how long you have to repay, and the penalties if you default.  Never sign off on a pawn shop loan until you understand all the terms and conditions.

Well, the easiest choice is to put it in a bank’s savings account.  A savings account is highly liquid — meaning you can withdraw your money anytime you want.  It is also safe because deposits up to P250,000 are covered by the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation.  If you want higher interest rate than a savings account, you may opt for a time deposit.  Here you park your money for a certain period of time and, in return, the bank offers you an interest rate relatively higher than what your regular savings account will get.  Like a savings account, time deposits are covered by the PDIC up to P250,000 per depositor.  Now, what if you still want a higher interest rate but are not willing to take additional risk?

Next thing you know, you’re crossing paths with your crush at your favorite lunch spot and time freezes.  You look around, then you run!  That's wrong; don’t run!  Avoiding someone makes the situation way worse than actually approaching him.  Go on, speak to him, give him a hug, ask him how his day is going.  Don’t hesitate!  Don’t call him your pal!  And don’t spill his coffee when embracing him!  Doing any of these things will make the entire situation awkward.  The first time you greet a guy in any way other than genuine, you could make the outcome of your meeting totally different.  A hug isn’t supposed to be awkward, even if you’re just hugging your crush that you’re afraid to talk to.  Just because he isn’t your boyfriend doesn’t mean you can’t show him physical attention.

Perhaps the most common religious scam is a variation of the Nigerian scam, which we wrote about in SCAMMED!  What We All Can Learn from These Real-Life Victims (under Foreign Inheritance).  In other religious scams, churches have been left with thousands of dollars of debt after being hoodwinked into signing costly leases for equipment they thought was free.  In this issue, we take a look at the most common types of church scams and offer some advice on how to avoid them.  The affinity church scam 'Affinity' simply means something like 'a shared understanding, interest or belief.'  And claiming to share someone else's viewpoint is the sneaky cover many church scam artists use.  Pretending to share their faith lulls members of religious organizations into thinking a scammer is genuine.  Often claiming some kind of divine guidance, using religious slogans, or claiming to be raising funds for a religious or other worthy cause, church scammers invite their new 'friends' to invest in what turns out to be nothing more than a Ponzi scheme paying for their personal lifestyle.",So is this scam that offers 20% monthly interest on my money a Ponzi scheme?,train,"[[0.9479690790176392, 0.05203089863061905], [0.9640845060348511, 0.035915493965148926], [0.8585963845252991, 0.14140358567237854], [0.9637532830238342, 0.036246731877326965], [0.8763253688812256, 0.12367458641529083], [0.9412142634391785, 0.058785781264305115], [0.8955820202827454, 0.10441800206899643], [0.9343993067741394, 0.06560074537992477], [0.9035661816596985, 0.09643382579088211], [0.7618107795715332, 0.2381891906261444]]","[[1.6082862615585327, -1.294197916984558], [1.8064876794815063, -1.4835225343704224], [1.0595036745071411, -0.7441772222518921], [1.8038733005523682, -1.4766128063201904], [1.1282552480697632, -0.8298283219337463], [1.5318444967269897, -1.2414263486862183], [1.2101212739944458, -0.9389503002166748], [1.4753012657165527, -1.1810156106948853], [1.2668648958206177, -0.97062748670578], [0.7797098755836487, -0.3829230070114136]]",0.2381891906261444,0.09526988416910172

Wrapping Up We concluded in today’s discussion that the website is counted in mixed reviews as some are saying that their policies have fooled them by calling them baiting for money.  While others call it a complete legit as the website is always high on its offers, gifts on gift cards, and one can use the money in a very effective way, making it safe and reliable.

And that they guarantee you 15-20 hours per week of work.  However, after thoroughly reviewing American Consumer Panels, my conclusion is that it’s a scam.  Because instead of connecting you with real home product testing jobs, they have you sign up to paid survey sites like LifePoints and Inbox Dollars, through their affiliate links.  Related: American Consumer Panels Review: Get Paid to Test Products?  LifePoints and Inbox Dollars aren’t scam sites, but neither of them provide real product testing jobs.  They pay people a small amount of money to complete surveys.  Which is a legitimate way to make money, because you are still helping companies perform market research.  But you’re not actually testing products, you’re just answering questions.  And it’s not a job that pays $25 to $45 per hour either.  You get paid per survey you complete.

Such confusion is a common element in Ponzi schemes as the orchestrator tries to keep the fraud going and hide what is occurring.  It was true of the fraud committed nearly a century ago by Charles Ponzi, an Italian immigrant in Boston who cheated investors out of $20 million by convincing them that they could make a bundle by buying an obscure type of postal order whose value differed from country to country and redeeming it for a profit in the United States.  Ponzi schemes existed long before they bore Charles Ponzi’s name.  In fact, he got his idea after working at a Montreal bank whose founder had bilked depositors.

These lenders use money from private individuals to fund the loans they are offering.

The question that you should be asking yourself is how to identify a real lender from a scam?  What are signs to look out for?

It is based on a fake investment that one schemer (or group of schemers) gets other people to give money to.  In Ponzi schemes, the schemer basically says, 'I found a great way to make money fast.  The more you give me, the more I can invest in that cause, and the more I can earn for us all'.  But a Ponzi scheme doesn't actually 'earn money'.  Instead, all of the scheme's money comes from the investors.  Once a Ponzi scheme gets too many investors, the system will always crash.  This is because the investors all expect more money than they invested, and they will get impatient.  These schemes always stop one of three ways: The schemer runs away with the money they got.  This is what schemers try to do.  The schemer runs out of money; They will be unable to promise money back right away.  This is called liquidity, and makes investors panic and demand their money back, often all at once.",What’s an example of a Ponzi scheme?,train,"[[0.500527024269104, 0.4994729459285736], [0.7101357579231262, 0.289864182472229], [0.6921282410621643, 0.3078717589378357], [0.9073570966720581, 0.09264291822910309], [0.7556521892547607, 0.24434788525104523], [0.7779752016067505, 0.22202478349208832], [0.8398879766464233, 0.16011196374893188], [0.87187659740448, 0.1281234174966812], [0.8477433919906616, 0.15225663781166077], [0.8847361207008362, 0.11526387184858322], [0.8658199906349182, 0.13418003916740417], [0.7413361668586731, 0.2586638331413269]]","[[0.0771995335817337, 0.07509133964776993], [0.6340928077697754, -0.26195088028907776], [0.5726797580718994, -0.23740816116333008], [1.269648790359497, -1.0121346712112427], [0.7677299976348877, -0.36125826835632324], [0.8156538009643555, -0.4382518529891968], [0.9742758274078369, -0.6831192970275879], [1.0866353511810303, -0.8310185670852661], [1.009027361869812, -0.7079831957817078], [1.160988688468933, -0.8770766854286194], [1.0671738386154175, -0.7973207235336304], [0.7121790051460266, -0.34074586629867554]]",0.4994729459285736,0.21706868646045527

Ponzi used funds from new investors to pay fake “returns” to earlier investors.  Ponzi scheme organizers often promise high returns with little or no risk.  Instead, they use money from new investors to pay earlier investors and may steal some of the money for themselves.

Get started today » One of the concerns I’ve seen aimed at Bitcoin is the claim that it’s a Ponzi scheme.  The argument suggests that because the Bitcoin network is continually reliant on new people buying in, that eventually it will collapse in price as new buyers are exhausted.  So, this article takes a serious look at the concern by comparing and contrasting Bitcoin to systems that have Ponzi-like characteristics, to see if the claim holds up.  The short answer is that Bitcoin does not meet the definition of a Ponzi scheme in either narrow or broad sense, but let’s dive in to see why that’s the case.  Defining a Ponzi Scheme To start with tackling the topic of Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme, we need a definition.  Here is how the US Securities and Exchange Commission defines one: A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors.  Ponzi scheme organizers often promise to invest your money and generate high returns with little or no risk.  But in many Ponzi schemes, the fraudsters do not invest the money.  Instead, they use it to pay those who invested earlier and may keep some for themselves.",I know that there are similar schemes to Ponzi schemes.

Initially a promising young actress, Spitzeder became a well-known private banker in 19th-century Munich when her theatrical success dwindled.  Running what was possibly the first recorded Ponzi scheme, she offered large returns on investments by continually using the money of new investors to pay back the previous ones.  At the height of her success, Spitzeder was estimated to be the wealthiest woman in Bavaria.   Opening her bank in 1869, Spitzeder managed to fend off attempts to discredit her for a few years before authorities were able to bring her to trial in 1872.  Because Ponzi schemes were not yet illegal, she was convicted instead of bad accounting and mishandling customers' money and sentenced to three years in prison.  Her bank was closed and 32,000 people lost 38 million gulden, the equivalent of almost 400 million euros in 2017 money, causing a wave of suicides.  Her personal fortune in art and cash was stripped from her.   After her release from prison in 1876, Spitzeder was no longer employable and left Germany, but she returned in 1878 to publish her memoir.",I know that there are similar schemes to Ponzi schemes.

The following are the most prevalent types of securities and commodities fraud schemes: Investment fraud: These schemes—sometimes referred to as “high-yield investment fraud”—involve the illegal sale or purported sale of financial instruments.  The typical investment fraud schemes are characterized by offers of low- or no-risk investments, guaranteed returns, overly-consistent returns, complex strategies, or unregistered securities.  These schemes often seek to victimize affinity groups—such as groups with a common religion or ethnicity—to utilize the common interests to build trust to effectively operate the investment fraud against them.  The perpetrators range from professional investment advisers to persons trusted and interacted with daily, such as a neighbor or sports coach.  The fraudster’s ability to foster trust makes these schemes so successful.  Investors should use scrutiny and gather as much information as possible before entering into any new investment opportunities.

Certificates of deposit are usually low-risk and insured instruments, but the Stanford certificates of deposit were fraudulent.   Section::::Red flags.   According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), many Ponzi schemes share similar characteristics that should be 'red flags' for investors.  The warning signs include:  BULLET::::- High investment returns with little or no risk.  Every investment carries some degree of risk, and investments yielding higher returns typically involve more risk.  Any 'guaranteed' investment opportunity is often considered suspicious.   BULLET::::- Overly consistent returns.  Investment values tend to go up and down over time, especially those offering potentially high returns.  An investment that continues to generate regular positive returns regardless of overall market conditions is considered suspicious.   BULLET::::- Unregistered investments.  Ponzi schemes typically involve investments that have not been registered with the SEC or with state regulators.

In particular, they describe a sustainability problem that they say happens when the number of new contributors declines.  William G. Shipman of the Cato Institute argues: In common usage a trust fund is an estate of money and securities held in trust for its beneficiaries.  The Social Security Trust Fund is quite different.  It is an accounting of the difference between tax and benefit flows.  When taxes exceed benefits, the federal government lends itself the excess in return for an interest-paying bond, an IOU that it issues to itself.  The government then spends its new funds on unrelated projects such as bridge repairs, defense, or food stamps.  The funds are not invested for the benefit of present or future retirees.  This criticism is not new.  In his 1936 presidential campaign, Republican Alf Landon called the trust fund 'a cruel hoax'.",What other similar schemes to Ponzi are there?,train,"[[0.7872729897499084, 0.21272699534893036], [0.9748363494873047, 0.025163667276501656], [0.9516241550445557, 0.048375796526670456], [0.953312337398529, 0.04668763279914856], [0.9659636616706848, 0.03403632715344429], [0.9609321355819702, 0.03906790912151337], [0.9526675343513489, 0.04733246937394142], [0.9642291069030762, 0.03577086701989174], [0.9814566373825073, 0.018543343991041183], [0.9712849259376526, 0.028715116903185844]]","[[0.8452404737472534, -0.46332505345344543], [1.984625220298767, -1.6722432374954224], [1.6409562826156616, -1.3382142782211304], [1.6542505025863647, -1.3622127771377563], [1.8239549398422241, -1.5217429399490356], [1.749879002571106, -1.452723503112793], [1.644861102104187, -1.3572083711624146], [1.7983691692352295, -1.4958258867263794], [2.142341375350952, -1.8265856504440308], [1.9135428667068481, -1.607653260231018]]",0.21272699534893036,0.053642012551426886

It is based on a fake investment that one schemer (or group of schemers) gets other people to give money to.  In Ponzi schemes, the schemer basically says, 'I found a great way to make money fast.  The more you give me, the more I can invest in that cause, and the more I can earn for us all'.  But a Ponzi scheme doesn't actually 'earn money'.  Instead, all of the scheme's money comes from the investors.  Once a Ponzi scheme gets too many investors, the system will always crash.  This is because the investors all expect more money than they invested, and they will get impatient.  These schemes always stop one of three ways: The schemer runs away with the money they got.  This is what schemers try to do.  The schemer runs out of money; They will be unable to promise money back right away.  This is called liquidity, and makes investors panic and demand their money back, often all at once.",What other similar schemes to Ponzi are there?,train,"[[0.9139398336410522, 0.08606012165546417], [0.9306631088256836, 0.06933686882257462], [0.8678916692733765, 0.13210831582546234], [0.969730794429779, 0.030269216746091843], [0.9386820197105408, 0.06131792813539505], [0.9595407247543335, 0.0404592826962471], [0.9636262059211731, 0.03637376427650452], [0.9500989317893982, 0.049901023507118225], [0.9389116168022156, 0.06108842045068741], [0.9693037867546082, 0.03069615364074707], [0.9649643898010254, 0.035035617649555206], [0.9443815350532532, 0.05561847612261772]]","[[1.3207184076309204, -1.0420001745224], [1.44715416431427, -1.1497663259506226], [1.0947034358978271, -0.7877413034439087], [1.8847453594207764, -1.5821418762207031], [1.5119627714157104, -1.2164417505264282], [1.7344094514846802, -1.4317493438720703], [1.7907296419143677, -1.4861260652542114], [1.621967077255249, -1.3245576620101929], [1.5132871866226196, -1.2191118001937866], [1.8841315507888794, -1.5683090686798096], [1.8098844289779663, -1.505841612815857], [1.5569626092910767, -1.2750521898269653]]",0.13210831582546234,0.05735543246070544

By 5 December 1492, Columbus had arrived at western Hispaniola, where he founded the colony of La Navidad and became its first viceroy.  Then he sailed to eastern Cuba.  This became the launch-pad for the creation of New Spain, created when the greatest Aztec city, Tenochtitlan, was defeated in 1521.  European colonisation of central and South American could begin in earnest.  The Rio de la Plata (River Plate) estuary was the border between a now-united Spain 's colony of Peru, of which Argentina was a part, and the Portuguese colony of Brazil. 'River plate' means 'river of silver' in Spanish.  This describes the river itself rather than the estuary, where the rivers Paraná and Uruguay meet.  It was first discovered by Europeans in 1516 when the Spanish navigator, Juan Diaz de Solis, was killed by the indigenous people whilst exploring the Rio de la Plata.

The current capital of the province is the city of La Plata, founded in 1882.

Francis denied the charges.)  But Francis also seems to be an opponent of austerity, most notably during his time as spiritual leader of Argentina when the country defaulted on its debt in 2002.  A paper by Thomas Trebat, 'Argentina, the Church, and Debt,' details the church's role in the crisis's resolution.  Argentine bishops, including Francis, had long criticized the laissez-faire policies of Carlos Menem, who was president from 1989 to 1999.  'The bishops were critical of the economic model as a generator of poverty and unemployment, notwithstanding the stability it had brought to the country,' Trebat wrote.

In different periods, both women's and men's fashions have highlighted one area or another of the body for attention.  In particular, the wearing of skirts and trousers has given rise to common phrases expressing implied restrictions in use and disapproval of offending behavior.  For example, ancient Greeks often considered the wearing of trousers by Persian men as a sign of an effeminate attitude.  Women's clothing in Victorian fashion was used as a means of control and admiration.  Reactions to the elaborate confections of French fashion led to various calls for reform on the grounds of both beauties (Artistic and Aesthetic dress) and health (dress reform; especially for undergarments and lingerie).  Although trousers for women did not become fashionable until the later 20th century, women began wearing men's trousers (suitably altered) for outdoor work a hundred years earlier.  In the 1960s, André Courrèges introduced long trousers for women as a fashion item, leading to the era of the pantsuit and designer jeans, and the gradual eroding of the prohibitions against girls and women wearing trousers in schools, the workplace, and fine restaurants.  Corsets have long been used for fashion, and body modification, such as waistline reduction.","Thanks, but I’m not asking about clothing.

You will see a lot of young children or college going students in football jerseys since football is quiet a popular sport in Argentina.

One reason that dress is important for men is that it projects social status; women who reject a man in a Burger King uniform might be willing to date someone in medical scrubs.  The quality of non-work clothing also conveys an impression about where a person shops and their disposable income.  Women are attracted to other signs of high social status, from elite diction to driving an expensive car, or dining at a posh restaurant (3).  Perhaps, for this reason, many still prefer if the man pays the expenses of a date.  In our society, this is a sign of having disposable income and being generous enough to dispose of it.  Even in societies that did not use money, men were expected to bring gifts when they courted.  This practice bears analogy with the nuptial gifts of birds and insects where the female is lulled into a sense of security by getting a morsel to eat.  The act of generosity is invariably by the male.  This fits in with Bateman's Principle according to which males are more eager to mate and therefore must do something to win over the female.","Thanks, but I’m not asking about clothing.

It takes the name from the city of Buenos Aires, which used to be part of the province and the provincial capital until it was federalized in 1880.  Since then, in spite of bearing the same name, the province does not include the national capital city proper, though it does include all other localities of the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area surrounding it.  The current capital of the province is the city of La Plata, founded in 1882.   The province is the only within the whole Argentina to be divided into 'partidos' and furtherly into 'localidades' (the rest have 'departamentos'), and borders the provinces of Entre Ríos to the northeast; Santa Fe to the north; Córdoba to the northwest, La Pampa to the west; and Río Negro to south and west; and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires to the northeast.

While it’s true (and unfortunate) that women have to be more careful, Argentina is a great place for solo female travellers.  There are a number of dangers and annoyances that women will need to be aware of in Argentina, but these can be avoided with certain precautions.  Here are some key ones: Like most South American countries, Argentina is home to a macho society.  This means catcalling, regularly and frequently from almost all men.  If you’re walking alone this is likely to occur.  Ignore it, and it will become background noise.  If you feel uncomfortable in a situation, feel that you’re in danger, or feel threatened by someone, move towards a public place, a shop, tourist police – find help.  Don’t walk around sketchy streets after dark e.g. parks, shortcuts down alleyways, all the usual stuff.  Just be careful and think, “Would I walk through a place like this at home?”  If in doubt get an Uber home.  Often the safer option.  Taxis aren’t always great for solo women travellers, in both Argentina and the whole world for that matter.","Mmm, meat sweats.

Many foragers are told not to bother with pheasant’s back mushrooms, also known as dryad’s saddles.  While it’s undisputed that they are edible (as in non-poisonous), many experienced foragers will tell you that they’re tough, chewy and not worth the bother.  This is their loss, as these mushrooms are quite good if you know how to treat them and when they’re best.  Forager Chef explains: The dryad saddle is a very firm mushroom.  I’ve heard of people eating it and not liking it, and saying it is inedible.  I have also heard people praise it for being delicious.  The confusing part is that both are right, It just depends on at what age you happen to find the mushroom.  You wouldn’t want to eat the stem of asparagus when it’s old and woody, although you could make soup with them.  The Dryad Saddle is the same way.","Mmm, meat sweats.

Many meat dishes are cooked in tomatoes and red wine and others in lemon such as lamb fricasse, which is lamb cooked with endives or romaine lettuce and an egg-lemon sauce.  Garlic is used heavily as are onions and potatoes in the many stews and oven baked dishes.  There is a pork dish similar to fricasse which is made with celery and served in the winter called hirino me celino.  Dolmades(stuffed grape leaves),kolokithia gemista, (stuffed zuchinni), tomates ke peperies gemista (stuffed tomatoes and peppers) and laxano gemista(stuffed cabbage) are other examples of stretching the meat by using it with rice and vegetables.  Pastitsio (photo) is like lasagna though not as saucy and is made with pasta, ground beef, tomatoes, onions and garlic and béchamel sauce.  Giovetsiis lamb baked with orzo pasta and tomato sauce.  For Easter the most popular food for most of Greece is whole lamb roasted on a spit.  This is especially popular because it follows 40 days of fasting for lent and people are definitely ready for some meat, though not everyone fasts the entire forty days.","Mmm, meat sweats.

Section::::History.:Pre-Columbian Patagonia (10,000 BC – 1520 AD).   Human habitation of the region dates back thousands of years, with some early archaeological findings in the area dated to at least the 13th millennium BC, although later dates around the 10th millennium BC are more securely recognized.  Evidence exists of human activity at Monte Verde in Llanquihue Province, Chile, dated to around 12,500 BC.  The glacial-period ice fields and subsequent large meltwater streams would have made settlement difficult at that time.   The region seems to have been inhabited continuously since 10,000 BC, by various cultures and alternating waves of migration, the details of which are as yet poorly understood.  Several sites have been excavated, notably caves such as Cueva del Milodon in Última Esperanza in southern Patagonia, and Tres Arroyos on Tierra del Fuego, that support this date.

Section::::National statistics.:Self-definition.   The ethnicity data used in UK national statistics relies on individuals' self-definition.  The Office for National Statistics explain this as follows:  This self-defined categorisation was also used for classifying ethnicity in the 2001 UK Census.

Another popular breakfast item is the pao de queijo, a stuffed bread roll made from tapioca flour and filled with melted cheese.  You can find the pao de queijo throughout Rio, but the most famous franchise is Casa de Pao de Queijo where the pao de queijo always tastes flaky and hot.  But, American and European tourists generally prefer a heartier breakfast, leading a few Brazilian restaurants to launch American-style bakeries or brunch options.

Nevertheless, there was also a migratory flow of German, Swiss, and Middle-Eastern immigrants arriving in Argentina.  Among the countless changes this melting pot brought was the enrichment of culinary art.  Dishes such as pasta, pizza, pucheros ( stews ), croquetas ( fritters ), sauces, embutidos ( sausages ), and chicken and meat courses brought a wider scope of options to daily menus.

Argentineans love beef.  In fact in Buenos Aires many locals eat beef a dozen times a week.  So great is their respect for this noble meat that no Argentinean would ever dream of marinating it or of seasoning it with anything other than salt.  Still, two condiments are commonly served with grilled meats: a gusty parsley-garlic sauce called chimichurri and a robust relish called salsa criolla.  The former is a cross between pesto and vinaigrette, made with fragrant fresh flat-leaf parsley and a nose-blasting dose of garlic.  (Don't worry about bad breath: the parsley acts as a breath freshener.)  Salsa criolla combines tomatoes, onions and peppers.As in North America, a typical Argentinean steak house would serve baked potatoes or french fries.  But at least one Buenos Aires restuarant—Las Naszarenas—also offers a sort of pan-fried potato-onion frittata called Tortilla Española.",That’s sad to hear.

Merienda is important to the Filipinos because they find the gap between lunch and  dinner too long, and they need to take many breaks from the intense  tropical heat.  Lumpia (spring rolls), puto (little cupcakes made from ground rice), and panyo-panyo (tiny pastry envelopes filled with mango and banana jam) are a few merienda dishes.  Anything can be served with the snack except steamed rice.   Steamed rice constitutes a complete meal, which merienda is not considered.  6 POLITICS, ECONOMICS, AND NUTRITION About 22 percent of the population of the Philippines are classified as  undernourished by the World Bank.

A cup of freshly made mate.  The Argentine tea culture is influenced by local and imported varieties and customs.  The country is a major producer of tea ( Camellia sinensis ), but is best known for the cultivation and consumption of mate, made with the leaves of the local yerba mate plant.  Contents 1 History 2 Tea production 3 Yerba mate 4 Tea-drinking customs and establishments 5 References History When Jesuit missionaries first came to Argentina, they tried to ban the popular indigenous tea, yerba maté, out of concern about its addictive qualities.  They ultimately reversed their stance and began cultivating yerba maté on plantations in the Misiones province in particular (and elsewhere in South America), until the expulsion of the religious order from the Americas in 1767 during the Suppression of the Society of Jesus.  The first varieties of non-native tea to be grown in colonial Argentina were introduced from Russia in 1920.  Beginning in 1924, the Argentine government urged farmers to experiment by planting tea seeds that the government imported from China and then distributed to interested farmers.",How do I prepare mate?,train,"[[0.7762113809585571, 0.2237885743379593], [0.3202085793018341, 0.6797914505004883], [0.9840272665023804, 0.015972742810845375], [0.9153188467025757, 0.08468113094568253], [0.8497470021247864, 0.150253027677536], [0.9370266199111938, 0.06297343224287033], [0.9904080033302307, 0.00959199108183384], [0.9461502432823181, 0.05384968966245651]]","[[0.814831018447876, -0.4288920760154724], [-0.18562838435173035, 0.5671850442886353], [2.187495708465576, -1.9332741498947144], [1.3186237812042236, -1.0617557764053345], [1.0250622034072876, -0.7075557708740234], [1.4712828397750854, -1.2287160158157349], [2.439218759536743, -2.197969675064087], [1.5619479417800903, -1.304256796836853]]",0.6797914505004883,0.16011275490745902

Yet, those made with butter are often sweeter in flavor.  You’ll find medialunas served at most Argentinean cafes.  They are a morning treat that goes great with coffee.  This includes Brazilian or Cuban coffee.  Enjoy this treat plain or filled with fruit.  They sometimes even come topped with a sugar glaze.  Or try dipping them in dulce de leche for a decadent treat.  3  . Chocotorta Chocotorta Chocotorta is a standard Argentine dessert item for celebrating birthdays.

This awe-inspiring site can be humbling – a crucial reaction if we want to protect our planet and enjoy this natural beauty for, hopefully, millennia to come.  Here are ways to access the falls from the three bordering countries.  Paraguay Coming from Paraguay, you will have to cross into either Brazil or Argentina to view the falls, with the former being the simplest option.  If you are coming from the capital, Asunción, you will need to make your way to the popular border town of Ciudad del Este.  From Ciudad del Este, frequent minibuses and taxis ferry you over the very lackadaisical border.  You then have the option to visit for the day and return to Paraguay, or move on and continue your trip through Brazil or Argentina.  Brazil All major cities in the southern portion of Brazil offer direct busses to Iguazu, but to avoid an enormously lengthy journey, the easiest hub to use is the state capital of Curitiba.  From there, a comfortable 10-hour overnight bus will drop you right in the center of Foz do Iguacu, the Brazilian town adjacent to the waterfall.

Located on the Iguacu river and situated on the territory of two countries.  Brazilian Iguacu Falls, in Portuguese Cataratas do Iguaçu, lie in the Paraná province.  Argentinian Iguazu Falls, in Spanish Cataratas del Iguazú, lie in the province of Misiones.  It’s good to consider visiting both sides of the falls as each of them offers different but still fascinating views.  Waterfalls were first recorded by a Spanish conquistador Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca in 1541.  Today the falls are a UNESCO heritage.  Together with waterfalls there are two national parks formed by a rainforest under protection.  Going on a tour in the national park means meeting animals like butterflies, toucans, parrots, caymans, monkeys or raccoons and jaguars in their natural environment.

After The Great French Wine Blight, many vines were left devastated; the remaining crops took a another large hit during the 1950’s when a heavy frost killed nearly ¾’s of the Malbec crop in France, which led to a decrease in the grapes use and popularity in France.  The vine rootstocks were transported to New World regions like Argentina in an effort to invigorate the vine's production.  Wines made with Malbec grapes are balanced, smooth and very drinkable with a well-rounded mouthfeel.  The Malbec grape develops widely different flavors depending on where it is grown; when grown in France it has pronounced leathery flavors and flavors of currant, black plum and can be quite bitter, while Malbec grapes grown in Argentina have pronounced fruit flavors of plum, cherry and blackberry, chocolate, floral and hints of leather.  The differences in the characteristics of Malbec grapes grown in different regions explains why the grapes are used so differently in wine making in each region, with Malbec being part of a blend in France and used solely to make a 100% varietal wine in Argentina.",I like hiking and Malbec wine.

Most people in the US are more familiar with the smoked chipotle, also called smoked jalapenos, but the Pasilla Oaxaca possesses a bit less heat than the chipotle and twice the smokiness.  It is in the hilly region of Oaxaca in southern Mexico that these long pasilla chilles are smoked.  These chiles are popular in vegetarian dishes for their rich smokiness that brings out a bacony ham flavor without the addition of any meat.

But as the population expanded, it became necessary to add descriptive information to distinguish between individuals of the same name.  Also, in the past, the first born babies were named after their parents.  But today, parents focus on uniqueness and distinctiveness of the name.  They pick names that are fashionable, trendy, and unique.  So it’s common to name children after sports, political, and pop culture celebs.  In earlier times, baby names needed to be Spanish as Argentina is largely a Spanish speaking country.  If parents wanted a name of a different ethnicity or language for their children, they needed to seek permission from the Government.  But this rule has now been relaxed.  There are still some conditions pertaining to baby names, but that’s to stop parents from picking weird and unusual names that can affect the child in later life.  Additionally, it was mandatory for married women to take their husband’s name.  But the law now allows women to use their maiden name.  She can add her husband’s name to her name if she wishes to do so.  Below MomJunction has compiled a list of unique and beautiful Argentina baby boy and girl names for your reference.

Opening a euro-denominated bank account is essential if you travel or work in Europe.  The European Union has 27 member countries, of which 16 have adopted the euro as their currency.  You benefit from being able to use your credit and debit cards in any of the 16 countries without concerns about exchange rates and associated charges.  ATM withdrawals are usually free.  The euro is also widely accepted in European countries that haven't adopted the euro.  U.S. citizens can open a euro bank account as the U.S. government doesn't impose restrictions.  However, the Internal Revenue Service does require you to declare assets in a euro bank account if the amount deposited exceeds the currency equivalent of $10,000.  You should also declare dividend and interest payments credited to your euro account.  Step 1 Choose one of the 16 European countries to open a euro bank account (see Resources).

The EBF is an obvious dialogue partner for the European institutions in laying out this legislation.   Furthermore, the role of the Federation as the united voice of all EU banks has naturally led it to be a forum where members' initiatives are proposed and debated.  Meetings are arranged on matters of concern to the whole European banking sector, specialised Working Groups and Committees analyse specific questions and propose solutions, leading to the publication of reports or position papers.   Finally, the role of the Federation is by no means limited to European matters.  It extends to broader issues of importance to all European banks vis-à-vis their counterparts and supervisory authorities throughout the world.   Section::::Members.","Awesome, good to know.

The US Federal Reserve has been conducting open market operations since the 1920s through the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The European Central Bank (ECB) says that the Eurosystem’s regular open market operations consist of: – Main Refinancing Operations: also known as MROs.  These are one-week liquidity-providing operations in euros.  They serve to steer interest rates over the short term, to signal the monetary policy stance in the euro zone, and to manage the liquidity situation.  – Longer-Term Refinancing Operations: also known as LTROs.  These are three-month liquidity-providing operations in euros.  They serve to provide additional financing to the financial sector over the long term.  In an article published online by the International Monetary Fund – Transformations to Open Market Operations – Stephen H. Axilrod writes: “By buying or selling bonds, bills, and other financial instruments in the open market, a central bank can expand or contract the amount of reserves in the banking system and can ultimately influence the country’s money supply.  When the central bank sells such instruments it absorbs money from the system.”  “Conversely, when it buys it injects money into the system.","Awesome, good to know.

He was unable to get the bank dissolved, but refused to renew its charter.  Jackson attempted to counteract this by executive order requiring all Federal land payments to be made in gold or silver.  This produced the Panic of 1837.   Section::::1837–1862: 'Free Banking' Era.   In this period, only state-chartered banks existed.  They could issue bank notes against specie (gold and silver coins) and the states heavily regulated their own reserve requirements, interest rates for loans and deposits, the necessary capital ratio etc.  These banks had existed since 1781, in parallel with the Banks of the United States.  The Michigan Act (1837) allowed the automatic chartering of banks that would fulfill its requirements without special consent of the state legislature.  This legislation made creating unstable banks easier by lowering state supervision in states that adopted it.  The real value of a bank bill was often lower than its face value, and the issuing bank's financial strength generally determined the size of the discount.

One in five consumers find open banking valuable, 14 with the interest higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation (figure 1).  Nearly one-half of Gen Z respondents and 39 percent of millennials see value in open banking, in contrast to only 23 percent or fewer of older respondents.  This generational difference could be an important factor for bank leaders to consider as they pursue open banking strategies.  Our previous research 15 on digital banking, as well as our current survey, indicates that younger consumers tend to use more savings, payments, and budgeting apps, a behavior correlated with interest in open banking.  The main reasons more younger consumers said they were in favor of open banking were “flexibility and transparency” and making things “less of a hassle.”  But, generally, consumers are most interested in services that make financial management easier, such as being able to compare bank services, integrate financial data, and personalize budgeting tools.",Does Open Banking exist in the United States?,train,"[[0.968785285949707, 0.031214755028486252], [0.21415165066719055, 0.7858484387397766], [0.3795963227748871, 0.6204037070274353], [0.6119529604911804, 0.38804706931114197], [0.8073782324790955, 0.19262181222438812], [0.7196910977363586, 0.28030890226364136], [0.2843194603919983, 0.7156805992126465]]","[[1.864949107170105, -1.5702028274536133], [-0.4968228042125702, 0.8032568097114563], [-0.12480773031711578, 0.3664543628692627], [0.32457593083381653, -0.1309528648853302], [0.8848848938941956, -0.5481786727905273], [0.6696962118148804, -0.27323371171951294], [-0.32098013162612915, 0.602155327796936]]",0.7858484387397766,0.4305893262582166

Where most products are developed to establish a unique position in a crowded market, product innovation may aim to replace the entire market with something new.  This is a difficult thing to achieve and true innovations are rare.  The following are common types of product innovation.  Time Reducing time consumption including things that improve productivity or represent a customer convenience.  For example, software that reduces the time for an interior decorator to produce a floor plan from 4 days to 4 hours.  Efficiency Reducing the inputs required to achieve a goal.  For example, it currently costs around $10,000 a pound to launch things into orbit.  It is believed that this can be reduced to less than $100.

( Read More: How Data and New Technologies Are Transforming Digital Lending ) 2. Expansion of Open Banking More and more regulatory bodies globally are requiring banking organizations to enable customers to share their data securely with third parties to power new financial services and increase competition in the banking industry.  By making account and payment data available through secure application programming interfaces (APIs), consumers have greater freedom and control in how they interact with their financial service providers.  Open banking APIs accelerate innovation and collaboration, leading to expanded banking ecosystems that could include more than just financial services to make a consumer’s lifestyle better.  What is exciting about open banking is that making consumer consent a central part of open banking strategy places an increased emphasis on consumer value propositions.  In other words, if improved value isn’t part of the open banking consumer proposition, the customer will not allow the sharing of their data.

Internal banking operations at a retail bank involve opening new accounts, transferring money between accounts, and assisting customers with managing deposits.  Business banking is another common banking operation.  Overall, business banks function very similarly to retail banks, except that their clientele consists primarily of businesses.  Companies require a wide variety of banking services, including start-up loans, collecting deposits, and investments.  Due to the complexities of many businesses, business banking is often more complex and sophisticated than retail banking.  Companies often rely on banks for treasury functions, including managing the business’ accounts receivable and payable.  Private banking has become less common over the past years, which is partially due to the recent trend of larger banks opening up private banking departments.  Private banking is tailored toward wealthy clients who typically have a net worth exceeding $1 million.

It becomes difficult to choose the one practice when there is plenty of options are available, but every method has its own usability and relevance.  One just needs to evaluate their needs and pick the one which fits in well with his requirements.  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)  How many Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are there?  APIs can be categorized into four types: Open or Public APIs which are publicly available, Partner APIs that require specific rights to be used, Internal or Private APIs which are mostly used inside a company and are kept private, and Composite APIs that combines various data and service APIs.  How do you test an Application Programming Interface (API)?  API testing is the process in which an API is tested on the basis of its functionality, performance, security, and reliability and this testing is performed by the application layer.  There are various methods of API testing and the popular ones include testing an API for expected results, group test cases by test category and test for failure.

That said, more collaboration than ever is taking place between banks and fintech firms, leveraging the benefits that each can bring to the table to create customer-centric solutions.  This collaboration has lead to the emergence of Open Banking and APIs, using customer data and innovations to create new revenue streams and more contextual services.  “Fintechs are now earning higher positive customer experience scores than traditional banks, and banks are openly seeking to collaborate with fintechs,” said Anirban Bose, Global Head of Banking and Capital Markets, Capgemini.  “Open Banking offers banks an opportunity to retain and grow their customer base as they add the varied services of third parties to personalize and customize products and services.

Application Programming Interface management, or API management, consists of a set of tools and services that enable developers and companies to build, analyze, operate, and scale APIs in secure environments.  API management can be delivered on-premises, through the cloud, or using a hybrid on-premises – SaaS (Software as a Service) approach.  At their simplest level, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) enable communication between disparate software applications.  Developers can connect APIs from different companies and services to achieve specific results.  Popular API uses include enabling the implementation of libraries and frameworks across languages, specifying the interface between an application and an operating system, manipulating remote resources through protocols, and defining the interface through which interactions happen between a third-party and the applications that use its assets.

The number of high profile and high value crypto heists suggests that this playbook of best security practices is still being written.  The wealthiest crypto investors are going to great lengths to protect their intangible hoard by using cold storage devices placed in physical (offline / airtight) vaults and bunkers.  Not every crypto investor can afford this level of security no more than every crypto investor is a target, but all are subject to the emerging nature of care, custody and control standards.  Here too, the absence of a basic “floor” in terms of security and capital guarantees, like a cyber Federal Deposit Insurance Corporate, FDIC, means that investors are exposed on a first-loss basis.  Cyber Risks On All Sides – As is true with cyber threats, which evolve according to Moore’s law, the space between the keyboard and the chair (or the smart phone and the digital wallet) is as important as the cyber hygiene and defenses of the crypto custodian.","Interesting, I’ve heard about Coinbase.

The banking relationship will allow the exchanges’ crypto customers to complete withdrawals, wire transfers and deposits to and from Coinbase and Gemini, establishing a critical bridge for the digital asset ecosystem.  Although Bitcoin is censorship-resistant and is not controlled by governments, central banks or central authorities, the network needs participation from major financial institutions in order to reach mass adoption.  Without bridges in place that allow customers to link their bank accounts to a cryptocurrency exchange, enabling smooth and rapid transfers, the reach of digital assets could remain limited in scope.  Both Coinbase and Gemini have focused on developing strong regulatory frameworks that ultimately allowed them to pass a strict vetting process on the road to approval by the banking giant.  The JPMorgan Chase turning point, at least at the outset, lessens the argument that Bitcoin will effectively be stamped out by choking off crucial access points: primarily traditional banks that allow dollars to be converted into BTC and other cryptocurrencies.  As more dollars flow into the cryptosphere and as digital assets become more entrenched in the financial system, the more likely it is that Bitcoin and its cousin coins can survive and thrive.","Interesting, I’ve heard about Coinbase.

But perhaps the biggest draw of today’s launch was the Falcon Heavy’s unique payload: a Tesla Roadster riding atop the rocket’s second stage.  Musk announced in December that the “midnight cherry red” convertible, which he owns, would be the first Falcon Heavy payload.  Then, on Monday, he revealed another surprise: a spacesuit-clad mannequin called “Starman” (a reference to David Bowie’s song “Starman”) in the driver’s seat, with its right hand on the wheel and left arm resting on the door.  So to sum up, Musk sent his car to mars with a “driver” named for a David Bowie song on a launch vehicle named after a Star Wars spaceship.

These classes are called derived class.  The main advantage of using this concept of inheritance in Object oriented programming is it helps in reducing the code size since the common characteristic is placed separately called as base class and it is just referred in the derived class.  This provide the users the important usage of terminology called as reusability Reusability: This usage is achieved by the above explained terminology called as inheritance.  Reusability is nothing but re- usage of structure without changing the existing one but adding new features or characteristics to it.  It is very much needed for any programmers in different situations.  Reusability gives the following advantages to users It helps in reducing the code size since classes can be just derived from existing one and one need to add only the new features and it helps users to save their time.  For instance if there is a class defined to draw different graphical figures say there is a user who want to draw graphical figure and also add the features of adding color to the graphical figure.,What does SpaceX's rocket engine reusability mean and why do they care?,validation,"[[0.929245114326477, 0.07075491547584534], [0.9387473464012146, 0.06125257909297943], [0.9173551201820374, 0.08264487236738205], [0.5281091928482056, 0.47189080715179443], [0.23110739886760712, 0.7688925862312317], [0.5834749937057495, 0.4165250360965729], [0.4736228585243225, 0.5263772010803223], [0.9159345030784607, 0.08406545966863632]]","[[1.4273406267166138, -1.1478099822998047], [1.505277156829834, -1.224263072013855], [1.3496521711349487, -1.0572896003723145], [0.13522200286388397, 0.022666560485959053], [-0.46200406551361084, 0.7400646209716797], [0.2710561156272888, -0.06599889695644379], [0.040788378566503525, 0.14639511704444885], [1.335181474685669, -1.0531675815582275]]",0.7688925862312317,0.31030043214559555

In terms of feeding propellants to the combustion chamber, liquid-propellant engines are either pressure-fed or pump-fed, and pump-fed engines work in either a gas-generator cycle, a staged-combustion cycle, or an expander cycle .  A liquid rocket engine can be tested prior to use, whereas for a solid rocket motor a rigorous quality management must be applied during manufacturing to ensure high reliability.  A Liquid rocket engine can also usually be reused for several flights, as in the Space Shuttle and Falcon 9 series rockets, although reuse of solid rocket motors was also effectively demonstrated during the shuttle program.  Bipropellant liquid rockets are simple in concept but due to high temperatures and high speed moving parts, very complex in practice.  Use of liquid propellants can be associated with a number of issues: Because the propellant is a very large proportion of the mass of the vehicle, the center of mass shifts significantly rearward as the propellant is used; one will typically lose control of the vehicle if its center mass gets too close to the center of drag/pressure.",When did people first start caring about rocket engine reusability?,train,"[[0.9925200939178467, 0.007479947526007891], [0.9916398525238037, 0.008360140956938267], [0.9905679821968079, 0.009432029910385609], [0.9629464745521545, 0.037053585052490234], [0.9865511655807495, 0.013448890298604965], [0.9918527007102966, 0.008147358894348145]]","[[2.567636489868164, -2.320385217666626], [2.5123329162597656, -2.263551950454712], [2.4642696380615234, -2.189897298812866], [1.7956560850143433, -1.4619766473770142], [2.292726993560791, -2.002591371536255], [2.522371768951416, -2.2795088291168213]]",0.037053585052490234,0.013986992106462518

The idea of maternal care was developed during the 1950s, starting from two different, if overlapping, areas.  The first was a concern with the fact that the mother's extended absence — the effective loss of the mother — could lead to a depressive response on the part of the child (Spitz, 1946), to anxiety reactions, or to developmental delays.  The term was used in the same sense but in a somewhat more official way in John Bowlby 's report to the World Health Organization (1951), which provided a critical review of clinical studies and research on the harmful results of deficiencies in maternal care.

The company SpaceX is developing the technologies over a number of years to facilitate full and rapid reusability of space launch vehicles.  The project's long-term objectives include returning a launch vehicle first stage to the launch site in minutes and to return a second stage to the launch pad following orbital realignment with the launch site and atmospheric reentry in up to 24 hours.  SpaceX's long term goal is that both stages of their orbital launch vehicle will be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return.   The program was publicly announced in 2011.  SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015.  The first re-flight of a landed first stage occurred in March 2017 with the second occurring in June 2017, that one only five months after the maiden flight of the booster.  The third attempt occurred in October 2017 with the SES-11/EchoStar-105 mission.  Second flights of refurbished first stages then became routine.

As the satellites headed on their way Wednesday, the booster rocket began its descent toward the ocean for a landing on a special floating platform.  Video footage of the attempt seemed to show the booster touching down, then flames, before the picture froze.  As with previous attempts, SpaceX had said landing the reusable booster rocket would be made more difficult by the fact that it would be falling from higher up.  And, the company said, the rocket would have less fuel than normal to control its descent.  SpaceX founder Elon Musk later tweeted that it appeared the the thrust in one of three landing engines was insufficient, causing the rocket to come in far too fast.  In what he said may have been SpaceX's 'hardest impact' ever, the booster ultimately suffered an RUD, or 'rapid unscheduled disassembly.'

During launch, the external tank fed the fuel under pressure through small ducts that branched off into smaller lines that fed directly into the main engines.  Some 450 kg (1000 lb.) of fuel were consumed by each of the main engines each second.  Made from aluminum alloys, the space shuttle's external fuel tank was the only part of the launch vehicle that was not reused.

An inquiry into the disaster found that the seal between two sections of a booster rocket had failed, causing a gas leak, which then ignited.",What made the space shuttle so hard to reuse?,train,"[[0.8487756252288818, 0.15122437477111816], [0.9510688781738281, 0.04893120378255844], [0.940668523311615, 0.05933151766657829], [0.8978849053382874, 0.10211511701345444], [0.5457586050033569, 0.45424139499664307], [0.8545116186141968, 0.14548839628696442], [0.9767097234725952, 0.023290297016501427], [0.9858403205871582, 0.014159618876874447], [0.9539399147033691, 0.04606002941727638], [0.9741308689117432, 0.02586919441819191]]","[[1.0101652145385742, -0.71486496925354], [1.6363584995269775, -1.3308125734329224], [1.5450359582901, -1.2184141874313354], [1.2376880645751953, -0.9362529516220093], [0.2022802233695984, 0.018732232972979546], [1.0434138774871826, -0.7270199060440063], [2.02397084236145, -1.712181806564331], [2.2772574424743652, -1.9658427238464355], [1.675765872001648, -1.3548892736434937], [1.9661370515823364, -1.662355899810791]]",0.45424139499664307,0.1070711144246161

NASA didn't have a working reusable spacecraft until 1981, when the first space shuttle, named Columbia, made history.  5: The Space Shuttle, a Reusable Spacecraft The space shuttle Atlantis touches down at the Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility Oct. 6, 1997.  Atlantis was one of four space shuttles that served NASA between 1981 and 2011.  NASA In 1972, the Apollo program was winding down, and NASA was doing some technological soul-searching.  The Apollo rockets were single-use spacecraft.  The cost per mission was, well, astronomical.  A reusable spacecraft would not only save money, but it would also be an amazing technological advance.  After President Richard Nixon announced the plan to build a reusable spacecraft that would run multiple, perhaps indefinite numbers of missions, NASA developed the basic design: two solid rocket boosters attached to an orbiter module and an external fuel tank.  Advertisement There were considerable hurdles facing the project.  Since the equipment that protected previous spacecraft from Earth's searing atmosphere essentially disintegrated during re-entry, NASA needed an entirely new heat-shield concept.",What made the space shuttle so hard to reuse?,train,"[[0.9672017097473145, 0.03279832378029823], [0.926226794719696, 0.07377319037914276], [0.9286400675773621, 0.07135992497205734], [0.9588753581047058, 0.04112459719181061], [0.9769917130470276, 0.023008311167359352], [0.9218299388885498, 0.0781700611114502], [0.9675691723823547, 0.03243085369467735], [0.9097878336906433, 0.0902121290564537], [0.8628383874893188, 0.13716158270835876], [0.922044038772583, 0.07795596122741699], [0.9191122651100159, 0.08088777959346771], [0.8314608931541443, 0.1685391217470169]]","[[1.852568507194519, -1.5314611196517944], [1.423521876335144, -1.1066018342971802], [1.4214671850204468, -1.144517421722412], [1.7175195217132568, -1.4316351413726807], [2.0333704948425293, -1.715252161026001], [1.3684132099151611, -1.0990607738494873], [1.8482378721237183, -1.5474387407302856], [1.306883692741394, -1.0041638612747192], [1.0725266933441162, -0.766541063785553], [1.3686084747314453, -1.101840615272522], [1.3653682470321655, -1.0649774074554443], [0.9666342735290527, -0.6293820738792419]]",0.1685391217470169,0.0756184863857925

Bet not.  As previously mentioned we do think that it was an amazing marketing strategy.  But it can be more than that.  As Elon and Tesla always surprise its audience.  The announcement of the new Roadster was epic and what is more amazing than that is its speed.  Said to be the fastest car till production, period.  Although the Roadster is said to arrive for the customers by 2022.  But we think that there might be some news coming in late 2018 regarding the Roadster or some other Tesla news.  BFR Launch The BFR or Big Falcon Rocket is next after Falcon Heavy.  Elon said that BFR might be ready for “short hopper flights with the spaceship part”.  So taking this statement into account we can make an assumption that after the Heavy Falcon, the Big Falcon Rocket of BFR is next.  The Earth to Earth flights that Elon announced in late 2017 is also said to happen with the BFR.

Returned rocket parts have also been transported to SpaceX Hawthorne and SpaceX McGregor for engineering evaluation and testing.

For the first time, SpaceX stated in July 2014 that they are 'highly confident of being able to land successfully on a floating launch pad or back at the launch site and refly the rocket with no required refurbishment.'   By late 2014, SpaceX suspended or abandoned the plan to recover and reuse the Falcon 9 second stage; the additional mass of the required heat shield, landing gear, and low-powered landing engines would incur too great a performance penalty.   In September 2016, SpaceX announced that development was underway to extend the reusable flight hardware to second stages, a more challenging engineering problem because the vehicle is travelling at orbital velocity.  The reusable technology was to have been extended to the 2016 designs of both the tanker and crewed spaceship upper stage variants as well as the first stage of the ITS launch vehicle for the Interplanetary Transport System,  and is considered paramount to the plans Elon Musk is championing to enable the settlement of Mars.  In 2016, initial test flights of an Interplanetary Transport System vehicle were expected no earlier than 2020.

It is derived from the Falcon 9 vehicle and consists of a strengthened Falcon 9 first stage as the center core with two additional first stages as strap-on boosters.  The Falcon Heavy has the highest payload capacity of any currently operational launch vehicle, the second-highest capacity of any rocket ever to reach orbit, trailing the Saturn V, and the third-highest capacity of any orbital-class rocket ever launched (behind the Saturn V and Energia).   SpaceX conducted the Falcon Heavy's maiden launch on February 6, 2018, at 3:45 p.m. EST (20:45 UTC).  The rocket carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, as a dummy payload.  The second Falcon Heavy launch occurred on April 11, 2019 and all three booster rockets successfully returned to earth.   The Falcon Heavy was designed to carry humans into space beyond low Earth orbit, although , Musk does not plan to apply for a human-rating certification to carry NASA astronauts.

Initial testing was limited to components of the Raptor engine, since the test stands at the E-2 complex at Stennis were not large enough to test the full Raptor engine.  The development Raptor engine discussed in the October 2013 time frame relative to Stennis testing was designed to generate more than vacuum thrust.  A revised, higher-thrust, specification was discussed by the company in February 2014, but it was unclear whether that higher thrust was something that would be achieved with the initial development engines.   Raptor engine component testing began in May 2014 at the E-2 test complex which SpaceX modified to support methane engine tests.  The first items tested were single Raptor injector elements, various designs of high-volume gas injectors.   The modifications to the test stands made by SpaceX are now a part of the Stennis test infrastructure and are available to other users of the test facility after the SpaceX facility lease was completed.

Methane is a simple gas, a single carbon atom with four arms of hydrogen atoms.  Its time in the atmosphere is relatively fleeting compared to other greenhouse gases like CO 2 —any given methane molecule, once it’s spewed into the atmosphere, lasts about a decade before it's cycled out.  That’s a blip compared to the centuries that a CO 2 molecule can last floating above the surface of the planet.  But there are many sources of methane, so the atmospheric load is constantly being regenerated—or increased.  Methane’s sources Today, about 60 percent of the methane in the atmosphere comes from sources scientists think of as human caused, while the rest comes from sources that existed before humans started influencing the carbon cycle in dramatic ways.  Most of methane’s natural emissions come from a soggy source: wetlands, which includes bogs.  Many microbes are like mammals in that they eat organic material and spit out carbon dioxide—but many that live in still, oxygen-deprived spots like waterlogged wetland soils produce methane instead, which then leaks into the atmosphere.",How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?,train,"[[0.5661078691482544, 0.433892160654068], [0.7907348871231079, 0.20926512777805328], [0.6895827054977417, 0.3104172646999359], [0.7438059449195862, 0.25619402527809143], [0.6109383702278137, 0.3890616297721863], [0.8883629441261292, 0.11163707822561264], [0.854145884513855, 0.14585402607917786], [0.6996274590492249, 0.30037254095077515]]","[[0.23557375371456146, -0.03041486255824566], [0.8511413931846619, -0.47821930050849915], [0.5457675457000732, -0.2524016797542572], [0.7415515780448914, -0.3242935240268707], [0.3370302617549896, -0.1142280101776123], [1.1810758113861084, -0.8930515050888062], [1.045099139213562, -0.7223964929580688], [0.5783227682113647, -0.2672017216682434]]",0.433892160654068,0.26958673167973757

Rocket engines The biggest (and arguably the most interesting) part of a rocket is the propulsion system—the engine that powers it into the sky.  As we've already seen, rockets differ from jet planes (and other fuel-powered vehicles that work on Earth) because they have to carry their own oxygen supply.  Modern space rockets have main engines powered by a liquid fuel (such as liquid hydrogen) and liquid oxygen (which does the same job as the air sucked into a car engine) that are pumped in from huge tanks.  The fuel (also called the propellant) and oxygen  (called the oxidizer) are stored at low temperatures and high pressures so more can be carried in tanks of a certain size, which means the rocket can go further on the same volume of fuel.  External rocket boosters that assist a main rocket engine typically burn solid fuel instead  (the Space Shuttle's were called solid rocket boosters, or SRBs, for exactly that reason).",Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?,train,"[[0.9739066958427429, 0.026093261316418648], [0.9854345321655273, 0.014565513469278812], [0.9758668541908264, 0.024133212864398956], [0.9172378778457642, 0.08276218920946121], [0.6098997592926025, 0.3901002109050751], [0.8483368754386902, 0.15166309475898743], [0.7476956248283386, 0.252304345369339], [0.93218594789505, 0.06781400740146637]]","[[1.9565625190734863, -1.6630758047103882], [2.2191648483276367, -1.9952611923217773], [2.009429931640625, -1.6903070211410522], [1.3307784795761108, -1.0746169090270996], [0.31860965490341187, -0.1282813400030136], [0.9958480596542358, -0.7257682085037231], [0.7369725704193115, -0.3493874669075012], [1.453125, -1.1676385402679443]]",0.3901002109050751,0.12617947941180319

Hydrogen internal combustion engine development has been receiving more interest recently, particularly for heavy duty commercial vehicles.  Part of the motivation for this is as a bridging technology to meet future climate CO2 emission goals, and as technology more compatible with existing automotive knowledge and manufacturing.  Efficiency Since hydrogen internal combustion engines are heat engines, their maximum efficiency is limited by the Carnot efficiency.  In comparison, the efficiency of a fuel cell is limited by the Gibbs free energy, which is typically higher than that of Carnot.  Hydrogen combustion engines are particularly sensitive to transients in load, in terms of efficiency, and therefore more suited to constant load operations.  Pollutant emissions The combustion of hydrogen with oxygen produces water vapor as its only product: 2H 2 + O 2 → 2H 2 O However, within air hydrogen combustion can produce oxides of nitrogen, known as NO x. In this way, the combustion process is much like other high temperature combustion fuels, such as kerosene, gasoline, diesel or natural gas.  As such hydrogen combustion engines are not considered zero emission .  Hydrogen has a wide flammability range in comparison with other fuels.

The 'RD-701' is a tripropellant engine that uses staged combustion cycle afterburning of oxidizer-rich hot turbine gas.  This engine has two modes.  'Mode #1' uses three components: LOX as an oxidizer and a fuel mixture of RP-1 / LH2 which is applied for near earth surface conditions.  'Mode #2' also uses LOX, with LH2 as fuel in vacuum where atmospheric influence is negligible.   The use of less dense fuel components at maximum efficiency conditions allows minimizing the volume of fuel tanks and subsequently their mass down to 30%.

Solid rocket engines are used on air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, on model rockets , and as boosters for satellite launchers.  In a solid rocket, the fuel and oxidizer are mixed together into a solid propellant which is packed into a solid cylinder.  A hole through the cylinder serves as a combustion chamber .  When the mixture is ignited, combustion takes place on the surface of the propellant.  A flame front is generated which burns into the mixture.  The combustion produces great amounts of exhaust gas at high temperature and pressure .  The amount of exhaust gas that is produced depends on the area of the flame front and engine designers use a variety of hole shapes to control the change in thrust for a particular engine.  The hot exhaust gas is passed through a nozzle which accelerates the flow.  Thrust is then produced according to Newton's third law of motion.

QUESTION #529 previous | next What are the differences between jet airplanes and rockets?  Asked by: Sameer Singla Answer Both a jet engine and a rocket engine function by expelling hot gases opposite to the direction of desired acceleration.  Newton's third law of motion says that the action of the hot gases produces a reaction in the opposite direction on the jet or rocket propelled vehicle; the momentum imparted to the gases is exactly opposite to the momentum imparted to the vehicle.  The main difference between the two types of engine is that a rocket carries its own supply of oxygen for combustion.  A jet engine requires oxygen from the atmosphere for combustion, and so cannot operate in the vacuum of space.  Answered by: Paul Walorski, B.A., Part Time Physics/Astronomy Instructor BR> Answer Well, one is an airplane, and the other is a rocket!  That's quite a difference in my opinion!  Joking aside, there are serious differences between the working principles of a jet airplane and a rocket.  (The differences in detail are much greater I guess, but I am just a physicist.)

There is no hollow core going up into the black powder grain, therefore the name 'end-burner.'  Estes uses two types of black powder rocket fuels in the motor diagrammed above: a powerful 'thrust' rocket fuel, and a less powerful 'delay' fuel.  These two sections of rocket fuel are topped off by a powerful ejection charge, which produces volumes of gasses quickly in order to eject the nosecone and parachute.  A dissected stock E motor below shows the various sections of the motor.  A Dissected Estes E9-6 Model Rocket Engine In this motor, the nozzle was about 1/2-inch thick, weighed 5.5 grams, and had a 5/32-inch 'aperture,' or hole.  The 2.5-inch long, 38-gram rocket fuel grain was extremely solid and hard, like one single cylinder of rocket fuel.

Liquid rockets tend to be heavier and more complex because of the pumps used to move the fuel and oxidizer, and you usually load the fuel and oxidizer into the rocket just before launch.  A solid rocket is much easier to handle and can sit for years before firing.  The relative safety of building and flying model rockets is the result of the production and availability of pre-packaged solid model rocket engines.  The engines are produced by several manufacturers and are available in a variety of sizes with a range of engine performance.  The engines can be bought at most hobby stores and some toy stores for a modest price (average current price is 3 engines for $5).  The engines are used once and discarded; a new engine is inserted into the rocket for the next flight.  Before these engines became available, many young rocket builders lost limbs or life in the process of mixing rocket fuels.

These highly efficient engines were first flown on the US Atlas-Centaur and were one of the main factors of NASA 's success in reaching the Moon by the Saturn V rocket.  Rocket engines burning cryogenic propellants remain in use today on high performance upper stages and boosters.  Upper stages are numerous.  Boosters include ESA's Ariane 5, JAXA 's H-II, and the United States Delta IV and Space Launch System.

These engines may have a higher mass ratio, but are usually more reliable, and are therefore used widely in satellites for orbit maintenance.  Liquid rockets can be monopropellant rockets using a single type of propellant, or bipropellant rockets using two types of propellant.  Tripropellant rockets using three types of propellant are rare.  Some designs are throttleable for variable thrust operation and some may be restarted after a previous in-space shutdown.  Liquid propellants are also used in hybrid rockets, with some of the advantages of a solid rocket .

But musk has done nothing other than make hd streams of rocket landings.  The tech of rocket is basically the same as developed by Russians in the 70s (without supercomputers).  There is no, I repeat no breakthrough since then.  But more disturbingly, space x is promising that a rocket can be used multiple times (like a commercial airline) to bring down the cost and make it like a passenger airline.  The only problem is that it cannot be done (with current tech as musk has made no breakthrough).  It is a well known fact that making a new rocket/shuttle is far more economical than reusing the same as the cost of failure is too high.  As space x came to know some time back ( Rocket explodes on launch pad in blow to Elon Musk's SpaceX ).  It is far safer to build a new shuttle than even take a small risk of failure as the loss would be too high (which increases significantly if there are passengers).","What are the tradeoffs between Pressure-Fed, Electric Pump-Fed, Open Cycle, and closed cycle Rocket engines?",train,"[[0.9023337364196777, 0.09766628593206406], [0.9022940397262573, 0.09770593792200089], [0.8864986896514893, 0.11350137740373611], [0.940925657749176, 0.05907430499792099], [0.7781074047088623, 0.2218925952911377], [0.9277318716049194, 0.07226812839508057], [0.5612699389457703, 0.43873006105422974], [0.9670899510383606, 0.0329100638628006], [0.7337828874588013, 0.26621711254119873]]","[[1.243515968322754, -0.9799121022224426], [1.241952657699585, -0.9810253381729126], [1.156554102897644, -0.8989107012748718], [1.5057123899459839, -1.2623556852340698], [0.815647304058075, -0.43902385234832764], [1.4018292427062988, -1.150530219078064], [0.22986403107643127, -0.016453569754958153], [1.8284024000167847, -1.5521105527877808], [0.7048572897911072, -0.3090437352657318]]",0.43873006105422974,0.15555176304446328

The second stage tank of Falcon 9 is simply a shorter version of the first stage tank and uses most of the same tooling, material, and manufacturing techniques.  This approach reduces manufacturing costs during vehicle production.  All three cores of the Falcon Heavy arrange the engines in a structural form SpaceX calls Octaweb, aimed at streamlining the manufacturing process, and each core includes four extensible landing legs.  To control the descent of the boosters and center core through the atmosphere, SpaceX uses small grid fins which deploy from the vehicle after separation.  Immediately after the side boosters separate, the center engine in each burns for a few seconds in order to control the booster's trajectory safely away from the rocket.  The legs then deploy as the boosters turn back to Earth, landing each softly on the ground.  The center core continues to fire until stage separation, after which its legs deploy and land back on Earth on a drone ship.  The landing legs are made of carbon fiber with aluminum honeycomb structure.  The four legs stow along the sides of each core during liftoff and later extend outward and down for landing.","What are the tradeoffs between Pressure-Fed, Electric Pump-Fed, Open Cycle, and closed cycle Rocket engines?",train,"[[0.9428773522377014, 0.057122718542814255], [0.8968470692634583, 0.10315295308828354], [0.9036282896995544, 0.09637174755334854], [0.7397730350494385, 0.2602269947528839], [0.8990169167518616, 0.10098309814929962], [0.9409556984901428, 0.059044238179922104], [0.8326806426048279, 0.16731931269168854], [0.915603756904602, 0.08439619839191437], [0.939675509929657, 0.06032447889447212], [0.8925879001617432, 0.10741215199232101], [0.7992477416992188, 0.20075221359729767]]","[[1.5216292142868042, -1.2821050882339478], [1.2099217176437378, -0.9527508020401001], [1.240928292274475, -0.9972766637802124], [0.724982500076294, -0.31980663537979126], [1.2180910110473633, -0.9682576656341553], [1.5101600885391235, -1.258448839187622], [0.9610004425048828, -0.6437456011772156], [1.307809829711914, -1.0762516260147095], [1.5002950429916382, -1.2455017566680908], [1.1935398578643799, -0.9239118099212646], [0.8845356106758118, -0.4970639944076538]]",0.2602269947528839,0.11791873689402234

By examining the pressure trace of the chamber to determine how quickly the effects of the disturbance die away, it is possible to estimate the stability and redesign features of the chamber if required.   Section::::Engine cycles.   For liquid-propellant rockets, four different ways of powering the injection of the propellant into the chamber are in common use.   Fuel and oxidizer must be pumped into the combustion chamber against the pressure of the hot gasses being burned, and engine power is limited by the rate at which propellant can be pumped into the combustion chamber.  For atmospheric or launcher use, high pressure, and thus high power, engine cycles are desirable to minimize gravity drag.  For orbital use, lower power cycles are usually fine.   BULLET::::- Pressure-fed cycle: The propellants are forced in from pressurised (relatively heavy) tanks.  The heavy tanks mean that a relatively low pressure is optimal, limiting engine power, but all the fuel is burned, allowing high efficiency.  The pressurant used is frequently helium due to its lack of reactivity and low density.  Examples: AJ-10, used in the Space Shuttle OMS, Apollo SPS, and the second stage of the Delta II.","What are the tradeoffs between Pressure-Fed, Electric Pump-Fed, Open Cycle, and closed cycle Rocket engines?",train,"[[0.8247984647750854, 0.17520147562026978], [0.7820146083831787, 0.21798545122146606], [0.9687623381614685, 0.031237708404660225], [0.7658652663230896, 0.2341347634792328], [0.3942316472530365, 0.6057683825492859], [0.2570694386959076, 0.74293053150177], [0.6989039182662964, 0.3010961413383484], [0.7517378330230713, 0.2482621818780899], [0.24631059169769287, 0.7536893486976624], [0.8942198157310486, 0.10578015446662903], [0.9553096294403076, 0.044690441340208054]]","[[0.9410348534584045, -0.6081675887107849], [0.8504213094711304, -0.4270237982273102], [1.864357829093933, -1.5700355768203735], [0.802346408367157, -0.3827630281448364], [-0.07324429601430893, 0.3563147783279419], [-0.33810627460479736, 0.7231500148773193], [0.5825918912887573, -0.25949177145957947], [0.7490353584289551, -0.3588669002056122], [-0.3509677052497864, 0.7674193382263184], [1.1839768886566162, -0.9506117105484009], [1.6444545984268188, -1.4178212881088257]]",0.7536893486976624,0.31461605277251115

The majority of the launch cost comes from building the rocket, which historically has flown only once.  Compare that to a commercial airliner – each new plane costs about the same as Falcon 9 but can fly multiple times per day and conduct tens of thousands of flights over its lifetime.  Following the commercial model, a rapidly reusable space launch vehicle could reduce the cost of traveling to space by a hundredfold.

His third law states that for every action (force) in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction.  In other words, if object A exerts a force on object B, then object B also exerts an equal and opposite force on object A. Notice that the forces are exerted on different objects.  In aerospace engineering, the principal of action and reaction is very important.  Newton's third law explains the generation of thrust by a rocket engine.  In a rocket engine, hot exhaust gas is produced through the combustion of a fuel with an oxidizer.  The hot exhaust gas flows through the rocket nozzle and is accelerated to the rear of the rocket.  In re-action, a thrusting force is produced on the engine mount.  The thrust accelerates the rocket as described by Newton's second law of motion.

Rocket scientists have long hoped to fix this by safely landing at least a portion of the rocket so that it can be used again.

For a reusable Falcon 9, it is around Mach 6, depending on the mission.”  For their reusable rocket this means the lower and upper stage separation needs to happen earlier, which puts a lot of extra strain on the upper stage – this translates in less cargo handling capabilities since each stage needs more fuel, first to be able to fly back on their own to the launch side and second to compensate for the earlier separation.  Still, if you have enough of these rockets and launch them often enough, this will greatly compensate.

Figure 9.11.  1: The space shuttle had a number of reusable parts.  Solid fuel boosters on either side were recovered and refueled after each flight, and the entire orbiter returned to Earth for use in subsequent flights.  The large liquid fuel tank was expended.  The space shuttle was a complex assemblage of technologies, employing both solid and liquid fuel, and pioneering ceramic tiles as reentry heat shields.  As a result, it permitted multiple launches as opposed to single-use rockets.

The LS1 engine is the newer design that replaced the older LT1 engines.  The main difference between the LS1 and LT1 engines is the material used in the block.  LT1 engines were made out of cast iron while the LS1 engine blocks were made out of aluminum, except those made for trucks, which are still made out of cast iron for optimal strength and durability.  The change in metal used has distinct effects on how the engines perform.  The LS1 engines are much lighter compared to the LT1 engines, and in vehicles, reducing the weight always relates to better performance.  The aluminum block of the LS1 engine is also much better in dissipating heat compared to the cast iron block of the LT1.  This lets the engine achieve a higher compression without worrying about overheating the engine due to excessive heat.  Because of this and a variety of other factors, the LS1 engines produce more power than LT1 engines.  The LT1 engines produced prior to the release of the LS1 engines were rated at 260 hp, while the LS1 engine debuted at 345 hp and gradually increased over the years.",Are RD-270 and SpaceX Raptor rocket engines the same?

Combustion powers both propulsion systems, but the fuels and oxidizers are different.  Steam clouds, the product of the SLS main engines’ hydrogen-oxygen reaction, pour from an RS-25 engine during testing at NASA’s Stennis Space Center.  The RS-25 main engines are called “liquid engines” because the fuel is liquid hydrogen (LH2).  Liquid oxygen (LOX) serves as the oxidizer.  The boosters, on the other hand, use aluminum as fuel with ammonium perchlorate as the oxidizer, mixed with a binder that creates one homogenous solid propellant.  Making water makes SLS fly Hydrogen, the fuel for the main engines, is the lightest element and normally exists as a gas.  Gases – especially lightweight hydrogen – are low-density, which means a little of it takes up a lot of space.

As we saw above, the corals are dependent on algae photosynthesis so they need to be close to sunlight.  This is also the reason why it is popular for divers.  The corals will be close enough to the water surface that you can see it’s many colors from above the water.  Otherwise, it would not be able to catch the sun rays which are important for them (or for the algae).  Why Are Corals So Special?  Coral reefs are home to a vast majority of the species on earth.  Scientists believe that at least 25% of all marine species on earth are living in coral reefs.  According to National Geographics, it is assumed that more than 2 million animals and lifeforms are living at the coral reefs.  And many more species are dependent on the survival of the reefs.  Many of the little colorful fish we find in the oceans are growing up inside the coral reefs because they find protection among the corals.  They can quickly hide and find shelter inside the polyps when an enemy approaches.

Here’s what you need to know about this worldwide disaster.  1.  CORALS ARE ANIMALS.  A coral reef in the Red Sea near Obhor, north of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.  Image credit: Hassan Ammar / AFP/Getty Images Thousands of species of coral exist, and hundreds of those are hard or reef-building corals.  These individual coral animals, called polyps, look sort of like miniature sea anemones—a soft, tubular body topped by a ring of tentacles.  Each builds a hard, protective external skeleton of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) around its base.  Thousands together make up a reef, with each polyp connected to the next by a thin layer of tissue.  Reefs grow when polyps periodically lift off their base and secrete a new one, adding layers of calcium.  Sexual and asexual reproduction also increase the size of reefs by increasing the number of individual polyps.  Reef growth varies from 2 centimeters (0.8 inches) or less per year for massive corals up to 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) per year for branching corals.",What is happening to the corals?,train,"[[0.5272902846336365, 0.4727097153663635], [0.9342647194862366, 0.06573528051376343], [0.9260280132293701, 0.07397197932004929], [0.8476531505584717, 0.15234680473804474], [0.9162611365318298, 0.08373884856700897], [0.9105655550956726, 0.08943446725606918], [0.825523316860199, 0.1744767278432846], [0.9057084918022156, 0.09429147839546204], [0.9222943186759949, 0.07770569622516632], [0.8747088313102722, 0.12529121339321136], [0.8613230586051941, 0.1386769711971283], [0.7886672616004944, 0.2113327533006668]]","[[0.14395186305046082, 0.03468206897377968], [1.4715849161148071, -1.1825391054153442], [1.405595302581787, -1.1216228008270264], [1.0079760551452637, -0.7083359956741333], [1.3286372423171997, -1.063961148262024], [1.2969473600387573, -1.023612380027771], [0.9482717514038086, -0.6059544086456299], [1.2677809000015259, -0.9945458173751831], [1.3779631853103638, -1.0959726572036743], [1.1147348880767822, -0.8285154104232788], [1.0625853538513184, -0.7637369632720947], [0.8636820912361145, -0.45322853326797485]]",0.4727097153663635,0.1466426613430182

This can happened naturally, by outside force, or for growing purposes.  The sexual part of the reproductive coral is naturally a bit more complicated as sexual reproduction is fundamentally more complex than asexual reproduction.  While each coral species is unique, the majority of stony coral species produce male and/or female gametes.  That’s right: some corals will produce both male and female gametes depending on conditions.  Most species of coral are broadcast spawners, meaning that each coral releases massive numbers of male (sperm) and female (egg) gametes into the water in order to distribute their offspring throughout the water.  As one can imagine, the timing of these mass spawning events must be timed perfectly and synchronized to be successful due to the stationary nature of mature corals.  The goal is for the egg and sperm from the individual corals to meet in the water, fusing to form free-floating or planktonic larvae.  These larvae are called planulae.  To compensate for the hazardous mode of reproduction, coral reproduce incredibly large amounts of planulae.  Within the coral life cycle, the highest mortality rate is in between that of the planulae and the stage of settlement.",What is happening to the corals?,train,"[[0.5689175128936768, 0.43108251690864563], [0.9303117394447327, 0.06968829035758972], [0.70518958568573, 0.29481041431427], [0.924379825592041, 0.07562018185853958], [0.9034109711647034, 0.09658901393413544], [0.8724082112312317, 0.12759184837341309], [0.7824767231941223, 0.21752327680587769], [0.8463374972343445, 0.1536625325679779], [0.946303129196167, 0.0536968894302845], [0.826015055179596, 0.17398500442504883], [0.8351796865463257, 0.1648203432559967]]","[[0.23728857934474945, -0.04014738276600838], [1.4466711282730103, -1.144816279411316], [0.6228773593902588, -0.24925686419010162], [1.3910166025161743, -1.112383246421814], [1.2498043775558472, -0.9859082698822021], [1.101403832435608, -0.8210171461105347], [0.8366917967796326, -0.44346654415130615], [1.0065631866455078, -0.6995961666107178], [1.5866680145263672, -1.282539963722229], [0.9492672681808472, -0.6083765625953674], [0.9697265625, -0.6530642509460449]]",0.43108251690864563,0.16900639202107082

Overfishing Whereas most undersea ecosystems foster plant growth, coral dominates certain regions because optimal conditions inhibit algae.  The alga is a non flowering plant, like seaweed, that conducts photosynthesis.  While such organisms are beneficial to plant life, they can restrict needed oxygen for coral and repress beneficial bacteria.  According to researchers, this can reduce coral generation up to 37 percent.  Much of this reduction relates to overfishing.  This practice eliminates fish and other species that feed on algae, keeping the plants’ presence at a non-threatening level.  Fortunately, technology exists to extract algae near the reefs with machines.  Nevertheless, long-term health is preserved only through dialing back the fishing.  Epidemic Among Diadema Antillarum One of the primary species that feast on algae is the diadema antillarum, or the black sea urchin.  Over 30 years ago, however, the urchins started to die off, especially in the Caribbean reefs and elsewhere in the south Atlantic.  The disease is still mysterious to marine epidemiologists but its symptoms are consistent: loss of pigment, build-up of sediment, spinal deterioration and loss of substrates (the spindle projections common among urchins).

All of the hardy, easy to care for leathers can fragged with a very high success rate.  One thing you need watch for is artificially died corals.  This is the unethical practice of injecting die into the leather coral in order to make it appear more colorful and sell it at a higher cost.  Leather corals are among the easier corals to die and one of the hardest corals for someone new to the hobby to identify as a potentially died coral.  The reason to avoid buy these corals is for two reasons, 1) the coral will almost always die within a few weeks, and, 2) not supporting the practice through not purchasing a died coral will help to stop the practice of dying corals.  The most common sign of a potentially died coral is it’s bright coloring.  In most cases this will be bright enough to look almost un-natural as well as almost neon.",What happens when all corals die?,train,"[[0.890185534954071, 0.10981452465057373], [0.915392279624939, 0.08460776507854462], [0.9469537734985352, 0.05304627865552902], [0.547272264957428, 0.4527277648448944], [0.8474805951118469, 0.1525193750858307], [0.6907344460487366, 0.3092655837535858], [0.5364267826080322, 0.4635732173919678], [0.8076685070991516, 0.1923314929008484], [0.916706383228302, 0.08329355716705322]]","[[1.1826857328414917, -0.9099512696266174], [1.3298341035842896, -1.0514925718307495], [1.582355260848999, -1.2997303009033203], [0.19277460873126984, 0.0031191683374345303], [1.0036956071853638, -0.7112807631492615], [0.5472623109817505, -0.2562926709651947], [0.16193316876888275, 0.015967434272170067], [0.8860313296318054, -0.5489000082015991], [1.3404514789581299, -1.0579646825790405]]",0.4635732173919678,0.21124217328098085

Check the basic parameters before you investigate other possible reasons.  The first thing that comes to my mind is to check the salinity.  If that’s on point, check the levels of calcium in the water.  All LPS corals, including the Torch Coral, need calcium in order to make their skeleton.  These corals can be affected by intense lighting, as well.  Avoid placing them under metal halides.  And always acclimate them slowly when you move them in a new tank.  And last, Torch Corals are susceptible to diseases and infections like any other organism.  The most common ones are the brown jelly and protozoan infections.  How to Propagate the Torch Coral The Torch Coral is a great candidate for propagation.  And it’s not that difficult to propagate it just by yourself, as well.  Especially with branching types of corals, like the Torch Coral itself.  First, make sure that that specimen you will use is in good health condition.  Cut off a branch, and then glue it on a new rock.  In time a new colony will form in that place.

As a result, when this happens the flow also needs to be adequate to move their waste products away.  It is also my opinion that in many tanks flow is still an underappreciated and under emphasized aspect of a successful tank.  So if corals die again for seemingly no reason, then flow around the dead coral and in the entire tank should be examined and usually increased.

This is of great concern to the scientific community because coral reefs harbor enormous amounts of biodiversity.  They also protect shorelines from storm surges and support the livelihoods of many people through fishing and tourism related activities.  Current models predict that most reefs will experience mass bleaching events by midcentury.  However, these models do not account for the ability of corals to adapt to heat stress.  Adaption may occur, for example, if heat tolerant zooxanthellae were to evolve inside of the coral tissue or if corals started to produce heat shock proteins that improved their tolerance to heat stress.  Cheryl Logan, an assistant professor at California State University, and her colleagues used models to explore the future state of coral reefs under different climate change scenarios when adaptation responses were either included or excluded from the analyses.  They found that the impacts of climate change on coral reefs were predicted to be less severe at the end of the 21st century if adaptive responses were included in models.  Furthermore, their data suggests that some degree of adaptation may have already occurred in corals in response to warmer water temperatures during the 20th century.

With so many animals mistaking plastic items and particles for food, or becoming entangled, the impact of plastic waste on marine life has become a global crisis.

However, the law does not appear to be enough of a deterrent for many active blast fishers.  Blast fishing remains a severe problem in modern times.  Environmental Impacts of Blast Fishing Blast fishing can have significant negative effects on coral reefs and marine animal populations.  It should also be acknowledged that blast fishing is just as unsustainable economically as it is environmentally.  Coral Reef Impacts Source The explosives used in blast fishing can release shockwaves that are threatening to marine ecosystems in general, and coral reef habitats in particular, as the AWI indicates.  The ESI says that coral reefs may require at least a century to return to normal after blast fishing has damaged their live coral, and that is assuming that their potential regeneration will not be disrupted by any other forms of outside interference.  Blast fishing is one of the two primary threats to coral reefs in Southeast Asia.

A sharp increase in water temperatures as seen in El Nino years can cause coral bleaching and eventual death to the coral.  Photo: Bleaching occurs when coral become stressed by heat, cold, chemicals, or other factors.  Photo courtesy of NOAA.  Some scientists believe that human actions are increasing greenhouse gases (gases like carbon dioxide that let in almost all the sun's radiation, but block much of the outgoing radiation from Earth).  They call this global warming.  They believe the Earth's atmosphere is getting warmer.  If true this could upset the delicate balance of temperatures that coral reefs need to thrive.  Coral reefs are important in determining the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  The zooxanthellae algae, through photosynthesis, remove carbon dioxide from the air and make carbohydrates available as food for both the zooxanthellae and the coral polyps.  Eventually, much of the carbon removed from the air will reside on the ocean bottom in the form of limestone produced by coral polyps.  However, both the coral polyps and the zooxanthellae must also use oxygen through the process of respiration (the same process humans use in breathing).

The parasite benefits by gaining nutrients, but does so at the expense of the host because it now needs to eat more in order to survive.  Zooxanthellae are photosynthetic algae that live inside coral polyps.  Coral polyps and zooxanthellae have a mutalistic symbiotic relationship.  The calcium carbonate skeleton produced by the coral polyps provides the zooxanthellae with a protected environment suitable for photosynthesis.  In return, the photosynthetic algae produce oxygen and aid the coral in removing waste.  Additionally, zooxanthellae provide the coral with nutrients such as glucose, glyserol, and amino acids, which are products of photosynthesis.  These compounds are utilized by the coral as building blocks in the manufacture of fats, as well as the synthesis of their calcium carbonate skeleton.  Some polyps are able to capture enough nutrients to survive without zooxanthellae, but these are rare.  It has been found that zooxanthellae donate up to ninety percent of the organic material produced during photosynthesis to the host coral tissue.

Coral also lives alongside algae, but if there are too many algae then they compete with corals for space.  This happens because climate change has given the algae an advantage over coral reefs.  It turns out that algae were not the only problem, as they also caused a change in the coral’s microbiome.  The high amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released by the algae allowed for an explosion of microbes and depleted all of the oxygen in the area.  The corals became unable to get any oxygen because their own microbes ate it up.  It was not a new pathogen that posed problems; instead, it was just an overgrowth of existing bacteria within these corals.  It is clear from this study that human activity has impacted how corals interact with their microbiomes.  Microbes play an important role in our health.  In fact, they help determine whether we are healthy or not.  They’re meant to live in harmony with each other.  When that harmony is disturbed, the microbes can change and cause disease.  This idea has been studied since the 1990s by scientists who study germ-free mice (mice without any bacteria).",Do corals capture carbon?,train,"[[0.9151774644851685, 0.08482258021831512], [0.9720312356948853, 0.02796873264014721], [0.9515385627746582, 0.0484614335000515], [0.9734495282173157, 0.026550417765975], [0.8715875148773193, 0.12841251492500305], [0.9567275047302246, 0.04327244311571121], [0.9792007207870483, 0.02079932391643524], [0.9810457229614258, 0.018954230472445488], [0.9857698678970337, 0.014230115339159966], [0.9822891354560852, 0.01771085523068905], [0.9884828925132751, 0.011517125181853771], [0.9704638719558716, 0.029536159709095955], [0.98014897108078, 0.019851040095090866]]","[[1.3156834840774536, -1.0628726482391357], [1.9208358526229858, -1.6274648904800415], [1.6261614561080933, -1.351150393486023], [1.9473830461502075, -1.6544173955917358], [1.095139980316162, -0.8199284076690674], [1.6835293769836426, -1.412473201751709], [2.072878837585449, -1.7789374589920044], [2.116028308868408, -1.8305634260177612], [2.251358985900879, -1.9867032766342163], [2.152510166168213, -1.863197684288025], [2.367636203765869, -2.084700345993042], [1.888765573501587, -1.603393316268921], [2.0985186100006104, -1.8009295463562012]]",0.12841251492500305,0.037852844008459494

Coral reef ecosystems take centuries to grow and develop, and it is no small matter to be losing them due to anthropogenic activities in a matter of years.  At least 19% of the world’s coral reefs – including 50% of those in the Caribbean – are already gone, and within 20 years, if current trends continue, we could lose another 15%, according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.

Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide further threaten the corals in other ways; as CO 2 dissolves in ocean waters, it lowers the pH and increases ocean acidity.  As acidity increases, it interferes with the calcification that normally occurs as coral animals build their calcium carbonate homes.  When a coral reef begins to die, species diversity plummets as animals lose food and shelter.  Coral reefs are also economically important tourist destinations, so the decline of coral reefs poses a serious threat to coastal economies.  Human population growth has damaged corals in other ways, too.  As human coastal populations increase, the runoff of sediment and agricultural chemicals has increased, too, causing some of the once-clear tropical waters to become cloudy.  At the same time, overfishing of popular fish species has allowed the predator species that eat corals to go unchecked.  Although a rise in global temperatures of 1–2˚C (a conservative scientific projection) in the coming decades may not seem large, it is very significant to this biome.

A decrease in coral cover can also reduce habitat for fish, with implications for reef-based fisheries.  Photo © Stacey Kilarski, Thailand Coral bleaching and associated mortality not only have negative impacts on coral communities, but they also impact fish communities and the human communities that depend on coral reefs and associated fisheries for livelihoods and wellbeing.  Ecological impacts of coral bleaching and related mortality: Bleached corals are likely to have reduced growth rates, decreased reproductive capacity, increased susceptibility to diseases and elevated mortality rates.  Changes in coral community composition can occur when more susceptible species are killed by bleaching events.  Changes in coral communities also affect the species that depend on them, such as the fish and invertebrates that rely on live coral for food, shelter, or recruitment habitat.

The 30 million tons of carbon dioxide our oceans absorb every day is changing the chemistry of seawater and increasing acidification.  Today, coral reefs are experiencing warmer ocean temperatures and more acidity than they have at any time in the last 400,000 years.  Acidification reduces the water’s carrying capacity for calcium carbonate that corals need to build their skeletons.

After experimentally planting some 400 samples from the two reef areas back into the two pools, Palumbi and his team found that the corals from the hotter pools transplanted more efficiently and grew faster than those from the cooler pools.  This August, Palumbi and his colleagues plan to begin an experimental restoration project on Sili Reef off Ofu Island.  To select the best corals, the researchers will rely on their extensive data for the area, including growth measurements and transcriptomes — blueprints of the part of the genome that is actively transcribed into proteins.  They also plan to use data from a portable stress test for corals that Palumbi is developing — “like a human treadmill test for cardiac function”, he says.  He and his team have built tanks out of 7.5-litre cooler boxes rigged with lights, heaters and chillers that can dose corals with a controlled bout of high physiological stress.  By monitoring bleaching and chlorophyll content, they should be able to predict how corals might respond to potential bleaching conditions.

Essentially, not all of the carbon dioxide that mankind emits remains in the atmosphere.  In fact, a fairly large portion enters the ocean, and this reduces its pH, which increases its acidity as a result.  Will Cause Coral Bleaching Consequently, ocean acidification may cause a reduction in the calcification rates of calcifying organisms.  These include corals, mollusks, algae and crustaceans.  By reducing the calcification rates of corals, ocean acidification will, in turn, cause coral bleaching.  Ocean Acidification and Climate Change Although climate change and ocean acidification are two very different environmental issues, they share the same cause: carbon dioxide emissions.  In essence, by reducing our emissions of carbon dioxide, we will not only mitigate climate change, but we will also help stop ocean acidification.  Although ocean acidification may sound like a trivial issue, it is not.  Importance of Coral Reefs Millions of marine species depend on coral colonies, and many of these species lie at the bottom of the oceans' food chain.

Increasing the pH and replicating pre-industrialization ocean chemistry conditions in the Great Barrier Reef, however, led to an increase in coral growth rates by 7%.   Section::::Coral health.:Temperature.   Ocean acidification can also lead to increased sea surface temperature.  An increase of about 1 or 2 °C can cause the collapse of the relationship between coral and zooxanthellae, possibly leading to bleaching.  Average sea surface temperature in the Great Barrier Reef is predicted to increase between 1 and 3 °C by 2100.  This breakdown of the relationship between the coral and the zooxanthellae occurs when Photosystem II is damaged, either due to a reaction with the D1 protein or a lack of carbon dioxide fixation; these result in a lack of photosynthesis and can lead to bleaching.

Under such conditions the zooxanthellae may lose substantial amounts of their photosynthetic pigmentation, which decreases rates of photosynthesis and produces bleaching.  In addition, studies have found that the chemicals in sunscreens and other personal care products can accumulate in areas with significant marine tourism and recreational use by humans and can promote viral infections in hard corals that lead to bleaching.  Exposure to increased temperatures and solar irradiance also causes zooxanthellae to manufacture abnormally large quantities of reactive oxygen species (molecules that contain oxygen and at least one unpaired electron ), which are toxic to both the algae and their coral symbionts.  These changes ultimately cause a breakdown of the symbiotic relationship, characterized by the physical separation of the zooxanthellae from their coral hosts.  If zooxanthellae do not recolonize the coral within a few months of leaving, their absence can result in the death of individual corals as well as the coral colony to which they belong.",How much coral has been bleached?,train,"[[0.9327464699745178, 0.06725353002548218], [0.8763666749000549, 0.12363339215517044], [0.8627423644065857, 0.1372576206922531], [0.870557963848114, 0.1294420063495636], [0.9581190347671509, 0.041880976408720016], [0.8815697431564331, 0.1184302419424057]]","[[1.4459062814712524, -1.1837575435638428], [1.1209982633590698, -0.8374655842781067], [1.058375597000122, -0.7798808813095093], [1.0893734693527222, -0.8165279626846313], [1.7255274057388306, -1.4046127796173096], [1.1393266916275024, -0.8680533170700073]]",0.1372576206922531,0.10298296126226585

This increases the Earth’s temperature, and this is known as Global warming.  In a nutshell, when the carbon dioxide increases, the global temperature increases, which leads to the rise in global warming and increasing global warming causes the greenhouse effect.  HOW DOES CARBON DIOXIDE CAUSE AIR POLLUTION?  In atmosphere carbon dioxide is occurred naturally.  During photosynthesis, it plays an essential part.  Since the Industrial Revolution, the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased.  Deforestation and burning of fossil fuels such as coal are the primary causes for this.  As the level of carbon dioxide is increased, it affects air pollution.  Less than 1 percent of the atmospheric gases, carbon dioxide is gauged.  However, between carbon dioxide and other gases, a delicate balance exists.  Carbon dioxide also plays its role in greenhouse gas, thus contributing to air pollution.  Now a question that arises here is how to overcome this problem of Air Pollution?  Planting those indoor and outdoor plants which absorbs carbon dioxide from air can be a solution to this cause.  This is an initiative you can take sitting in your homes and contribute to minimizing the air pollution.

NASA has observed increases in the amount of carbon dioxide and some other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.  Too much of these greenhouse gases can cause Earth's atmosphere to trap more and more heat.  This causes Earth to warm up.  What reduces the greenhouse effect on Earth?  Just like a glass greenhouse, Earth's greenhouse is also full of plants!  Plants can help to balance the greenhouse effect on Earth.  All plants — from giant trees to tiny phytoplankton in the ocean — take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen.  The ocean also absorbs a lot of excess carbon dioxide in the air.  Unfortunately, the increased carbon dioxide in the ocean changes the water, making it more acidic.  This is called ocean acidification.  More acidic water can be harmful to many ocean creatures, such as certain shellfish and coral.  Warming oceans — from too many greenhouse gases in the atmosphere — can also be harmful to these organisms.  Warmer waters are a main cause of coral bleaching.  This photograph shows a bleached brain coral.  A main cause of coral bleaching is warming oceans.  Ocean acidification also stresses coral reef communities.

Try to limit yourself to a carry-on bag.  This isn’t a requirement, just a suggestion.  (The extra airline fees are just the beginning of the trouble with extra or heavy bags—train stations and hotels don’t always have elevators!)  It’s tough but doable, especially if you plan ahead.  If you’re not sure if your suitcase is too heavy, carry it a couple of blocks at a fast clip, or up a flight of stairs without stopping.  If you’re uncomfortable, it’s too heavy.  (We recommend this activity for pre-dawn, before the neighbors wake up and wonder if you’ve finally gone over the edge.)  On most bicycle tours, you’re on the move with little time for laundry and drying.  When possible, travel with fast-drying clothing – from undergarments to outerwear.  Check out our clothing recommendations.  Synthetic fabrics/blends are not only the most breathable and quick drying, they can also be the easiest to pack (the worst fabric to ride in is cotton).",What's the difference between bike packing and bike touring?,train,"[[0.8551317453384399, 0.14486823976039886], [0.9590694308280945, 0.04093053936958313], [0.8381960988044739, 0.1618039309978485], [0.9086045622825623, 0.09139540046453476], [0.7593418955802917, 0.24065813422203064], [0.920590877532959, 0.07940910756587982], [0.7743359804153442, 0.22566398978233337], [0.8550482988357544, 0.1449517011642456], [0.8031975626945496, 0.19680243730545044], [0.9592207670211792, 0.04077920690178871], [0.9364832043647766, 0.06351683288812637], [0.9330289959907532, 0.06697102636098862]]","[[1.0460734367370605, -0.7293574810028076], [1.7218888998031616, -1.432198166847229], [0.9992634057998657, -0.6456032991409302], [1.278381109237671, -1.0183336734771729], [0.7811510562896729, -0.3679237365722656], [1.3581386804580688, -1.0922640562057495], [0.826531171798706, -0.4064275026321411], [1.0359529256820679, -0.7388044595718384], [0.8916416764259338, -0.5147586464881897], [1.714303970336914, -1.4436448812484741], [1.4831193685531616, -1.2077072858810425], [1.45514714717865, -1.1790289878845215]]",0.24065813422203064,0.1248125455652674

Two Wheel Gear says this bag is made of 600-denier TPE-coated polyester (so water will roll off of it), but it comes with a rain cover for true downpours.  The company offers a two-year limited warranty against defects in craftsmanship.  Flaws but not dealbreakers: The rain flaps that cover the zippers are very stiff, almost to a point of frustration.  We were often left wrestling with zippers caught at weird angles.  That said, we don’t think that’s a good enough reason not to buy this bag if you like everything else about it.  This bag may not be large enough if you want to carry along a lot of extras such as lunch and a change of clothes.  Two Wheel Gear does make a bigger bag, the Pannier Backpack Convertible Plus+, which is 30 L and would be the right size if that’s your goal.

View at REI THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN BUYING BIKEPACKING BAGS STYLE There are seven main styles of bikepacking bags listed above: Trunk Bag These sit on top of a rear rack and are one of the larger bags used when bikepacking.  Pannier These are used in a pair for even weight distribution and are typically attached to a rear or front rack.  Panniers will often boast the largest carrying capacity of all the bags available for bikepacking.  Seat-Pack or Saddle-Bag These attach to your seat and seat post and come in a variety of sizes.  They are often used for lightweight touring and bikepacking.  Frame Bag These sit in the middle triangle of your bike frame and will either take up the entire area (full frame bag) or part of the area (half frame bag).  Frame bags are great for storing heavier items as they help keep the center of gravity low when riding.  Top Tube Bag These are small bags that sit on the top tube of your bike.  Top tube bags are commonly used for storing valuables and ride nutrition and they provide easy access while riding.,Can any bike be used for bike packing?,train,"[[0.9420555233955383, 0.05794443562626839], [0.9662218689918518, 0.03377809748053551], [0.9721242785453796, 0.02787577547132969], [0.9816548824310303, 0.01834513247013092], [0.9387715458869934, 0.06122846156358719], [0.963655412197113, 0.03634456917643547], [0.9451746940612793, 0.054825309664011], [0.9775694012641907, 0.02243063785135746], [0.9818967580795288, 0.018103202804923058], [0.9758346080780029, 0.024165384471416473]]","[[1.5321165323257446, -1.2564631700515747], [1.8295177221298218, -1.524063229560852], [1.9275256395339966, -1.6241999864578247], [2.1445531845092773, -1.8353222608566284], [1.5079275369644165, -1.2220324277877808], [1.7853765487670898, -1.4923124313354492], [1.5637450218200684, -1.2834727764129639], [2.048130512237549, -1.7265111207962036], [2.152273654937744, -1.8411237001419067], [2.0105791091918945, -1.6877926588058472]]",0.06122846156358719,0.03550410065799951

Bikepacking bags attach directly to your bike without a rack.  Because there are so many different types and sizes of bikes, bikepacking bags have a lot more variation.  A typical bikepacking bag setup would include some or all of these parts: Handlebar bag (often a roll-style bag) Saddle / seat bag Frame bag Top tube bag for small items Feed bags for snacks and small items Bikepackers sometimes also attach mounts to the front fork for bottles or other small cargo.  This is an example of a bikepacking bag setup: Bikepacking in New Mexico Bikepacking bags are usually (but not always) associated with the “bikepacking” style, loosely defined as: shorter and/or more focused trips within a particular backcountry area, lighter and/or more minimal gear, more dirt trails than roads, more remote than populated, more camping than hotels.  Panniers: Pros and Cons To understand why different types of bike bags are used for different types of trips, it helps to understand what each type of system is best at.

The MTB-specific Shimano Steps E7000 motor is really responsive to pedalling input and only really needs to be used in full power on the steepest of climbs.  I’m really impressed with the new Merida eSilex +600 – it’s ready for a spot of bike packing, all you need to do is add bags.  The fact that it’s so light and has all those mounting points make it viable for touring / bike packing.  The battery range will depend on how much you rely on the e-assist – I would recommend riding it like a regular bike and use the electric to help you with steep climbs.  Another absolute corker of a bike is the BMC Alpenchallenge AMP Sport Three DB – with a fully carbon frame and Micro Travel system in the rear, it really does take the sting out of rough terrain.

Go to a local bike shop and see if they have any boxes left over.  All their stock will be sent in BIG cardboard boxes and they usually have some of these in stock.  Get one that's big enough and one that has handles if possible.  They should be able to give you some plastic axles too.  Get hold of some material that you insulate pipes with.  This comes in various thickness and you may be lucky with off cuts from a DIY store, alternatively use the mountains of bubble wrap you have after buying stuff from Scan!  Select first on the bike (big cog at the back) - this makes the rear mech not stick out.  If you can take the pedals off then this really helps.  Put the pipes around all of the main tubes and the rear seat stays.  Next, take off the front wheel and the seat post/seat.  Put plastic axle where front wheel went and put some more piping on the fork legs.  To put it into the box turn the handlebars through 90°.  You may have to let the tyres down to get it in.

You can find titanium touring bikes too, which are notably expensive, but they’re tough and light, and the vibration damping can be a godsend on rough roads and dirt.  Touring Bike Geometry There are a handful of subtle differences within touring bike geometries that set them apart from road bikes.  Touring geometry is more upright, creating a riding position that’s more comfortable during long hours in the saddle.  You’ll see different bike companies refer to this as their “endurance” or “adventure” geometry.  This “endurance” geometry plays out in a handful of different ways.  The wheelbase and chainstay of a classic touring bike is typically longer to make room for rear racks and panniers, and the bottom bracket is typically lower to increase stability.  The head tube is typically longer on a touring bike, essentially elevating the handlebar, and there’s more slack, helping to extend the wheelbase.  Touring bikes also generally have a shorter top tube, or more important, a shorter “reach,” which is the distance from the center of the bottom bracket to the top of the head tube.","OK, and what can I do to make my bike more comfortable?",train,"[[0.8273265361785889, 0.17267340421676636], [0.8178169131278992, 0.18218305706977844], [0.881375253200531, 0.1186247393488884], [0.4893089234828949, 0.5106910467147827], [0.8588517904281616, 0.14114820957183838], [0.7955166101455688, 0.20448337495326996], [0.7622823715209961, 0.2377176731824875], [0.7607730627059937, 0.23922695219516754], [0.8538219928741455, 0.1461779922246933]]","[[0.9750809669494629, -0.5917165279388428], [0.9386643171310425, -0.5629622340202332], [1.1569260358810425, -0.8485922813415527], [0.10889387130737305, 0.1516646444797516], [1.0595942735671997, -0.7461916208267212], [0.8954983949661255, -0.4630066156387329], [0.79964280128479, -0.36559054255485535], [0.8011175990104675, -0.3558048903942108], [1.0395509004592896, -0.7253468036651611]]",0.5106910467147827,0.2169918277197414

If this isn’t enough for you, consider checking out adjustable levers – a very common modification on sport bikes – that can extend or retract the lever to where it’s most comfortable for you.  Adjusting Your Clip-on Handlebars Some sport bikes allow you to rotate the clip-on bars to be closer in or wider out.  Just as with the levers, simply loosen the pinch bolts and rotate them in or out while sitting on the bike to a position that is more comfortable for you, then tighten them back up.  Tip: there are typically two pinch bolts holding clip-ons onto the fork leg – when tightening them, make sure to do them evenly, alternating with half-turns on each until they are both tight.  Check torque specs and use a torque wrench if you can – pinch bolts are usually not torqued very hard.  Adjusting Your Shifter Peg /Brake Everyone’s foot size is different, so where the shifter and brake pegs fall on your bike may not be where it’s most comfortable for you.

Cruisers If you’re looking for a comfortable bike with a classic look, consider a cruiser.  The bicycle standard from the 1930s through 1950s, cruisers feature wide tires and padded seats for a more comfortable riding experience.  Curved, upright handlebars put the rider in a better position to view the world around them.  Cruisers typically have heavier frames, but some newer models use lightweight aluminum frames.  The traditional cruiser has just one gear, but more modern cruisers come with three to seven speeds.  Also called beach bikes or boulevardiers, these classic bikes work best on flat terrain.  Utility/Cargo Bikes Perfect for hauling groceries, camping gear, and other items—utility and cargo bikes feature a sturdy, elongated frame with heavy-duty storage racks over the rear tires.  A variety of accessories can be hooked onto the rear rack, such as baskets, child seats, and panniers to hold your gear.  The upright seating position gives you a good view of the road, the rims have extra spokes for additional strength, and the wider tires offer a more stable ride.

Thank a Tank Bag There are a lot things you'll want to keep readily available as you ride and stuffing your pockets to the gills can make for a very uncomfortable ride.  A motorcycle tank bag is a must have for any long distance ride.  With the ability to safely store everything from your keys, phone, lip balm, point and shoot camera, sunglasses, water, and spare change, a tank bag can come in really handy.

Regardless of geometry changes, all good brands kit will kit women's bikes out with contact points that suit the average female rider, such as a wider shaped women’s saddle and narrower handlebars for our slim shoulders.

Mountain bikes generally feature a 'straight handlebar' or 'riser bar' with varying degrees of sweep backwards and centimeters rise upwards, as well as wider widths which can provide better handling due to increased leverage against the wheel.  Seating A Selle San Marco saddle designed for women Saddles also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more room for leg swings.  Comfort depends on riding position.  With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable.  For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient.

Their ability to make a huge hit with an obscure title like Guardians of the Galaxy is incredible, so I'd say Marvel right now has a feature film advantage.  DC has a shallower bench with fewer big properties, but their holy trinity of superman, batman and wonder woman is unequalled.  We will see how well they execute.  Marvel has a great many more valuable franchises currently but Marvel lacks the unified structure of DC so it's harder for them to explore their universe cinematically, with franchises divided over several studios, but even DC had to separate Arrow and Flash from Supergirl.  We will see whether DC can develop more successful characters with their upcoming, ambitious plans.  In print, they are both pretty feeble, both in terms of sales and in terms of imagination.  Stan Lee used to be a unifying force at Marvel, slightly more engaged that DCs Julius Schwartz, but it feels like both companies are drifting in their print divisions with DC's unsuccessful 52 reboot and Marvel about to do the same with Secret Wars.

This is certainly open to debate and remains unaddressed in the MCU at present, but the Ancient One does seem to imply that any sort of meddling with the timeline can create splits in the natural flow and use of the Time Stone certainly falls into this category.  Problematically, it clearly wasn't the intention of the Russo brothers ' or of writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely to imply that Scarlet Witch beat Thanos in a different timeline and several inconsistencies emerge as a result.  If using the Time Stone to rewrite Vision's death created a separate timeline, would that new plane of reality have its own set of Infinity Stones?  This was certainly the case when the Avengers traveled back through the Quantum Realm.  Additionally, if Thanos jumped from the reality with a destroyed Mind Stone to another, would that world not have its own version of Thanos?

'  You're the first one I've told that to. '  This makes perfect sense in terms of the overall narrative of the MCU.  Avengers: Endgame is the climax of the MCU to date, an event movie that's frankly unparalleled in the history of cinema.  While Thanos is sure to be defeated, there will be massive consequences for Marvel's entire shared universe, and Spider-Man: Far From Home is set to explore these.

Fans generally assume that each MCU phase will end with an Avengers film, but that's not necessarily the case.

This uncertainty, the feeling that anything could happen, helps make a world otherwise made up of borrowed elements feel novel, absorbing.  Conversely, Star Wars shows how an unfamiliar world can make a predictable plot feel wondrous.  The first three films indulged in mythic-formula storytelling but placed it in a magical junkyard future that seemed surprising, different, bizarre.  Now, The Force Awakens has ignited a debate about whether it’s okay for Star Wars to forgo further world-building.  If it is okay, it’s only because of how sturdy and inimitable George Lucas’s original universe was.  For a lot of people, the trappings of the 1977 Star Wars remains fresh enough to thrill; though the franchise has reshaped pop culture, lightsabers and TIE Fighters haven’t quite been as pervasively knocked off as Tolkien’s elvish cities and enchanted swords have been.  As for the storytelling: The Force Awakens apes A New Hope apes Joseph Campbell, but the the archetypal heroes themselves represent a small innovation.","Okay, what is the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise?",train,"[[0.9401413798332214, 0.059858664870262146], [0.9630993604660034, 0.036900609731674194], [0.9091355204582214, 0.09086449444293976], [0.9139295220375061, 0.08607044070959091], [0.6584994792938232, 0.34150052070617676], [0.90592360496521, 0.09407635033130646], [0.808312714099884, 0.19168728590011597], [0.8592391014099121, 0.14076091349124908]]","[[1.5273696184158325, -1.2266745567321777], [1.7874852418899536, -1.4744434356689453], [1.3047163486480713, -0.9984086751937866], [1.3309144973754883, -1.0316728353500366], [0.46301987767219543, -0.19359460473060608], [1.277476191520691, -0.9873720407485962], [0.9156272411346436, -0.5234564542770386], [1.06641685962677, -0.7425677180290222]]",0.34150052070617676,0.1302149100229144

Avengers: Endgame features a considerable amount of time travel, and one character's age in particular becomes especially hard to track.  By Hannah Shaw-Williams Published May 05, 2019 Share Share Tweet Email 0 Comment Captain America gets a happy ending in Avengers: Endgame, going back in time to finally get that dance with Peggy Carter before living out the rest of his life with her - but exactly how old is he by the end of the movie?  Between being frozen in the Arctic ice for 66 years, his modern adventures with the Avengers, Endgame 's five-year time jump and Steve's final trip back to the past, it can be hard to keep track.  In terms of his physical age, Steve hands over his shield to Sam Wilson when he's a spry 114 years old, or thereabouts.  However, he's actually been alive for about 180 years.  Though he's certainly got a few wrinkles when he meets up with Sam and Bucky again in 2023, he doesn't appear to be on the verge of death and clearly ages slower than a regular human being thanks to the super soldier serum.","Okay, what is the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise?",train,"[[0.9620347023010254, 0.037965327501297], [0.9791648387908936, 0.02083512954413891], [0.8650045394897461, 0.13499552011489868], [0.8505347371101379, 0.14946532249450684], [0.8879738450050354, 0.11202618479728699], [0.9506780505180359, 0.04932202026247978], [0.9767118692398071, 0.023288128897547722], [0.942115306854248, 0.05788473039865494]]","[[1.7909687757492065, -1.4414085149765015], [2.103400230407715, -1.7466591596603394], [1.0961179733276367, -0.7613751292228699], [1.0522955656051636, -0.6865053176879883], [1.1874486207962036, -0.8827611207962036], [1.6372209787368774, -1.321583867073059], [2.01688289642334, -1.7193650007247925], [1.5471621751785278, -1.2425118684768677]]",0.14946532249450684,0.07322279550135136

Don’t rush on easy- and medium-level difficulty problems to finish the test on time.  Many students think they have to finish the entire Math test before the 60 minutes are up, without guessing on any questions.  However, problems on the Math test get more difficult as you progress.  Students tend to rush through the easier questions, so they have more time to tackle the tougher ones.  But there’s a problem with this strategy, particularly for students who aren’t great at Math.  Working too quickly at the beginning of the Math test can cause you to make a lot of simple mistakes—and get lots of questions wrong.  Then—even though you have more time left—you get even more questions wrong because you can’t answer the more advanced problems correctly.  The sum total of this approach: lots of lost points.  A better approach, particularly if you’re looking for a big test score improvement, is: Take your time at the beginning of the test Make to answer as many of the first 40 problems correctly as possible Remember: all the problems on the test, regardless of their difficulty, are worth the same number of points.",That’s a great point.

As Marvel fans already know, the comic book incarnation of Shuri dedicated her life to becoming the first female Black Panther ever since childhood.  At first, T’Challa beat her to it, but Shuri continued to protect Wakanda against the likes of Ulysses Klaw and Radioactive Man, proving that she was worthy of the mantle.  Soon after, T’Challa vowed to train his sister how to fight, and ended up replacing the King of Wakanda as Black Panther after he fell into a dangerous coma, even though the Panther god, Bast, initially rejected her.  While Ryan Coogler’s movie adaptation does stray from the source material at times, subtle hints threaded throughout Black Panther suggest that actress, Letitia Wright, may still claw her way to center stage in the MCU one day, mirroring Shuri’s path in the comics.  The most notable example of this occurs early on in the film when Zuri (Forest Whitaker) asks if anyone is willing to challenge T'Challa for the power of Black Panther.",Could you expand on Justin Gilbert Alba’s comments that the push from fans for diversity in creators and characters only represents a loud minority?,train,"[[0.856039822101593, 0.1439601480960846], [0.8273742198944092, 0.17262576520442963], [0.8820345401763916, 0.1179654523730278], [0.856595516204834, 0.14340448379516602], [0.7512938976287842, 0.2487061321735382], [0.7742319703102112, 0.2257681041955948]]","[[1.0303422212600708, -0.7524381875991821], [0.9360514283180237, -0.6310795545578003], [1.1289511919021606, -0.8828881978988647], [1.0253807306289673, -0.761915922164917], [0.751489520072937, -0.354035347700119], [0.8247735500335693, -0.40758955478668213]]",0.2487061321735382,0.17540501430630684

You feel more validated and confident in your identities to see a story map out your heart and soul.  Kids need to feel confident in who they are from the earliest stages of development, and normalizing diversity is key to that goal.  Gwen J.: Diverse books are important for a way to walk in another's shoes, and learn about another's world and experiences.  They are a chance to see things from a perspective you may never encounter, in a place you may never go, and live in a culture you may never experience.  They help cultivate compassion, awareness, and understanding.  Many of us find our best friends in books.  They are a safe place to learn, love, and explore.  We can find ourselves in books, learn more about ourselves, and find our better selves that we aspire to be, often reflected in a character we identify with.  They teach us the kind of friends we want (and can be the link to finding them), good and bad ways of dealing with conflicts, and give us new things to think about in the way we view people and the world.",Could you expand on Justin Gilbert Alba’s comments that the push from fans for diversity in creators and characters only represents a loud minority?,train,"[[0.7097041606903076, 0.29029580950737], [0.6344711184501648, 0.3655288517475128], [0.6954845786094666, 0.30451542139053345], [0.7854247689247131, 0.21457524597644806], [0.5759686827659607, 0.4240313172340393], [0.6318612098693848, 0.36813879013061523], [0.7265771627426147, 0.27342283725738525], [0.7009709477424622, 0.29902908205986023], [0.6745474338531494, 0.3254525363445282], [0.6944569945335388, 0.3055429756641388]]","[[0.6430445909500122, -0.2509031891822815], [0.38412952423095703, -0.1673169732093811], [0.5929126143455505, -0.23297452926635742], [0.8544498682022095, -0.4431144595146179], [0.2502056360244751, -0.05604034289717674], [0.3804571032524109, -0.15975268185138702], [0.6973876953125, -0.2799375653266907], [0.6115665435791016, -0.24035902321338654], [0.5110350847244263, -0.21779026091098785], [0.5683523416519165, -0.2526874840259552]]",0.4240313172340393,0.3170532867312431

It’s a little easier said than done as the anime seems to be doing its own story while incorporating content from the manga.  It has felt like a long journey so far and knowing the BORUTO anime still has so much ground to cover is certainly unnerving.

At long last, Kawaki made his manga debut in chapter 23 on April 28th.  With his debut, it seems the BORUTO franchise is finally looking to get serious.  Minor spoilers ahead for BORUTO.

When I first read about these concepts, they brought tears to my eyes.  As a white person in a predominantly white country, I also began to gain a better understanding of and a greater appreciation for the black experience in the United States.  Is the Bible a book by a white God for white people?  Of course not.  God is spirit and does not have “color” in our human and earthly sense.  There is nothing in the Scriptures to indicate that people are excluded from God’s saving grace on the basis of ethnic origin or skin color.  God is “not wanting anyone to perish” (2 Peter 3:9).  Jesus is the Savior of all peoples.  Nevertheless, it is a fact that the majority of European artists and Bible commentators painted and described all biblical characters, including God, as white.  This had the effect of excluding blacks from being a part of Scripture and has led some people of color to question the Bible’s relevance to them.  Exclusion was only one side of the problem.  Where the presence of blacks in the Bible was admitted, primarily among uneducated whites, outrageous myths and fables abounded.",What is Marvel Studios’ approach to diversity for people of color?,train,"[[0.4880560040473938, 0.5119439363479614], [0.7767029404640198, 0.22329697012901306], [0.39939239621162415, 0.600607693195343], [0.8724861741065979, 0.1275138258934021], [0.8889400362968445, 0.1110600009560585], [0.8367182016372681, 0.16328178346157074], [0.8443619012832642, 0.15563812851905823], [0.969282865524292, 0.030717160552740097], [0.959298312664032, 0.040701694786548615], [0.6427423357963562, 0.3572576642036438], [0.7917293310165405, 0.20827069878578186], [0.8467002511024475, 0.1532997488975525], [0.6361858248710632, 0.36381420493125916]]","[[0.07320927083492279, 0.12099417299032211], [0.8141287565231323, -0.4324265718460083], [-0.0669279396533966, 0.34106969833374023], [1.1107348203659058, -0.812387228012085], [1.1847867965698242, -0.8951723575592041], [0.9857319593429565, -0.648277997970581], [1.0092642307281494, -0.6817833185195923], [1.8731812238693237, -1.5785537958145142], [1.7293912172317505, -1.4305411577224731], [0.4371352195739746, -0.15015143156051636], [0.8601284027099609, -0.47525250911712646], [1.0126665830612183, -0.6962850093841553], [0.41217902302742004, -0.14666835963726044]]",0.600607693195343,0.2344156546661487

In recent months, the company has become a go-to example of the lack of diversity in the technology industry.  Sixty percent of the company's employees are white; that jumps to 72 percent when looking at leadership roles.  Overall, fewer than 2 percent of Twitter's employees are black, and none are in leadership roles.  While it's true that many major tech companies have similar diversity statistics, but Twitter's numbers stand out because so many of its users are black.   And the disparity between the company and its users has not gone unnoticed.  To address some of those issues, Twitter announced that it has hired a new vice president for diversity and inclusion, Jeffery Siminoff.  The fifty-year-old replaces Janet Van Huysse, and comes from a similar role at Apple.  He is known for his extensive work with Out Leadership -- a group dedicated to demonstrating how equality in general makes for good business, with a particular focus on LGBT executives.   He was also named in a TechCrunch piece identifying '10 Men Making Waves for Women in Tech.'",Interesting.

He was vice president of sales for a medical software company, and when he wasn’t on the road he worked from home wearing a wireless earbud, troubleshooting client problems as he paced around his living room, looking out at the woods with a sense of well-being.  He was goal-oriented, and had almost accomplished his big one, “retire by age 50.”  The other, “spend time improving community,” was a work in progress.  He had instituted events such as the annual mulching of the nature trail, and that was how he’d met Maria, who’d also come to the chili cook-off by the pool and other events, always wearing a hijab.  Mickey found himself revisiting these interactions as he planned the Sunday meeting.  His wife, Allason, was nervous that holding it at their house might make them a target for troublemakers.

As a result, African American consumers have shifted to watching online digital content, said Tameez, who worked at the Star-Telegram in Fort Worth as a diversity writer covering social equity issues in 2018 and 2019.  “For communities of color and marginalized people, there is distrust with legacy media or traditional news outlets,” she said.  “They have poorly covered or ignored communities all together or have gotten stories wrong or only go into their communities for crime or violence.”  Tameez said increases in paid viewer subscriptions to shows such as #RolandMartinUnfiltered also can be attributed to relatability: Black viewers relate to reporters who don’t perpetuate racial stereotypes.  Recent research supports her point of view.  According to a recent study, the State of Consumer Engagement, 74 percent of Black viewers watch ethnic media occasionally and 44 percent watch frequently.

Breakbeat patterns may also occur briefly in the background at certain points.   Whilst breakbeat hardcore itself was not popular in Scotland, its synthesiser sounds were found in bouncy techno's range of stab melodies.  N-Joi's 'Live In Manchester' (1992) feast provided further general inspiration.  Its hallmark is the single-keyed offbeat note, which relates to its 'bouncy' designation (this offbeat focus was found in the latter bouncy house namesake).  These rhythmic combinations and arrangements were described by Simon Reynolds as being reminiscent of klezmer music, fairground-like melodies and oom-pah offbeat notes.   The N-Joi group provided another important attribute.  Unlike other rave music from this period, the Scottish scene was performance driven where bands often headlined raves rather than DJs.  Acts were expected to have costumes, dancers and the best stage performance.  Dancers were dressed in baggy tracksuit-like attire and had their own form of dance that involves a lot of rapid leg movements.  The performances of Ultra-Sonic filtered through to the like Scooter on a wider level.   Section::::See also.   BULLET::::- List of electronic music genres",Tech salaries are all the rave now.

How much do Cranston and Paul earn per episode as meth cooks?  Cranston takes home a cool $225,000 per episode, while Paul earns $150,000.  (Not bad for someone who was originally supposed to be killed off at the end of season one.)  That puts Cranston's salary for the final eight episodes of the series at $1.8 million.  Paul would take home $1.2 million.  For a comparison, Cranston is making as much as what each of the 'How I Met Your Mother' cast members earns ($225,000) and nearly as much as Damian Lewis on Showtime's 'Homeland' ($250,000).  Paul is earning as much as Peter Dinklage earns for his role on HBO's 'Game of Thrones' per episode and more than that of 'Elementary' star Lucy Liu ($130,000).  In total, season 5 has 16 episodes.  Provided Cranston and Paul's salary information is the same for the first eight episodes, that would put Cranston at $3.6 million for the entire final season of 'Breaking Bad' while his co-star Paul would make a total of $2.4 million.

Incorporating many components of those genres, the Florida breaks subgenre followed during the early-to-mid 1990s and had a unique sound that was soon internationally popular among producers, DJs, and club-goers.  In 1994, the influential techno act Autechre released the Anti EP in response to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, deliberately using advanced algorithmic programming to generate non-repetitive breakbeats for the full duration of the tracks, in order to subvert the legal definitions within that legislation which specified in the section creating police powers to remove ravers from raves that ''music' includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats'.  In the late 1990s, another style of breakbeat emerged, funky breaks, a style that was incorporating elements of trance, hip hop and jungle.

So you want a degree in tech, but you’re not sure which route to take.  These days, there are two strong paths to make a career in computers: Computer Science and Information Technology (IT).  Which is right for you?  A Comparison of Degrees To begin, it’s important to understand the distinctions of each.  In Computer Science, you’ll be learning how computers work.  This could be anything from computer languages, software design, or hardware architecture.  It’s just you and the computer having a conversation.  You’ll learn many of the same skills in IT, but your intentions will be different.  You’ll become the mediator between the machine and the end user.

This is because jobs at the top are rarer and require a more specialized set of skills.  Typically, you’ll need extensive industry experience – either at Facebook or another tech company – to command a position that is higher up on the Facebook salary band structure.  How Much do Facebook Software Engineers Earn?  Your salary and compensation package as a Facebook software developer will depend on your experience and assigned level.  Those who start at the entry-level will command an E3 salary, while more senior engineers will be assigned higher levels.  As you are promoted, you’ll work your way through these levels.  Facebook compensates its employees fairly, to say the least.  Even jobs at lower positions within the company offer excellent salaries that are comparable to those at companies like Microsoft.

That means growing up, but even worse, going to job interviews—OMG.  Before my first one, I obsessed not only about having flushed cheeks, a dry mouth and a racing heart, but also about picking the perfect outfit and equally perfect beauty look.  Needless to say, I was NERVOUS.  The morning of the interview, I swiped on my favourite red lipstick, MAC's Ronnie Red.  As I was ready about an hour too early (I am the queen of punctuality and proud of it!), I had a lot of time to sit and ponder my makeup.  'Are red lips too much?'  I found myself wondering.

You also have procured this task.  The contractor comes and does their part, and you release them by paying the agreed amount of money, and you close the contract.  Afterward, carpentry and painting work starts.  You also have procured these jobs.  Once these contractors complete their tasks, you make payment and then you close these contracts as well.  The building is ready, so you call the client to come and inspect it.  Once the client is satisfied, they accept the building, sign the acceptance letter, and all pending payments are released.  Once you get the payment, you update the lessons learned, and release the team and resources.  Finally, you close the project.

The close procurement process may occur many times during the project ’s life cycle, but the close project process will be performed only once at the end of the project.",What should I do next after getting an interview with a tech company?,test,"[[0.6109533905982971, 0.38904663920402527], [0.6111926436424255, 0.38880738615989685], [0.8207144141197205, 0.17928560078144073], [0.6866652965545654, 0.31333476305007935], [0.8344193696975708, 0.1655806452035904], [0.8506391048431396, 0.14936086535453796], [0.7335355281829834, 0.266464501619339], [0.3438478410243988, 0.6561521887779236], [0.3946644067764282, 0.6053355932235718], [0.3353307545185089, 0.6646692752838135], [0.7962872982025146, 0.20371265709400177], [0.8338642716407776, 0.16613566875457764], [0.6488945484161377, 0.3511054813861847], [0.7972233891487122, 0.20277662575244904]]","[[0.3497724235057831, -0.10154905170202255], [0.36084550619125366, -0.09148257225751877], [0.9459036588668823, -0.5752915740013123], [0.5372135639190674, -0.24736131727695465], [0.9819333553314209, -0.635344386100769], [1.0252107381820679, -0.7144119739532471], [0.7074988484382629, -0.30513614416122437], [-0.08839929103851318, 0.5577942132949829], [-0.016036828979849815, 0.41171038150787354], [-0.12109720706939697, 0.5630750060081482], [0.8909262418746948, -0.4723234474658966], [0.9821580648422241, -0.6311078071594238], [0.44909578561782837, -0.1650877147912979], [0.9050544500350952, -0.4639754295349121]]",0.6646692752838135,0.33584056368895937

After each set of interviews, start revising your canvas.  I went through more than 30 lean canvases before writing a line of code for Alumnify.  After that, make wireframes.  When we were starting out, we went with Balsamiq, which is simple and gives you a free trial.  Then take your wireframes and show them to as many customers as possible to get feedback.  Don't stop until you have 100 more interviews.  Great, now we have an idea of who our customer is and what we need to build for a minimum viable product.  Note that we did the Customer Discovery phase without any money or development experience.  Step 2: Learn the basics of development.  Start using Codecademy, Treehouse's free trial, or Code.org for two hours a day for about a month.  It won't make you a CTO, but you'll start learning the basics of coding.  Even having some understanding of what a developer does will help you be a better recruiter for your tech co-founder.

What is Diode Clipper?  Diode is a device which allows current to flow in only one direction.  For that purpose, we have seen that diodes are used as rectifiers.  But diode is not restricted to only this application in this article we will learn about another amazing application of Diode as a Limiters or mostly known as Clippers.  A clipper (or limiter) is used to clip off or cut off the portion of applied voltage (A.C) either in Positive direction or Negative direction.  Similarly, like Half Wave rectifiers the Clipper circuits clips the positive or negative pulse of a output depending on the circuit configuration.",Are search engines biased?,train,"[[0.6668084859848022, 0.33319154381752014], [0.9128774404525757, 0.08712257444858551], [0.9817138314247131, 0.018286196514964104], [0.9700560569763184, 0.029943956062197685], [0.968227744102478, 0.031772222369909286], [0.9476016759872437, 0.052398353815078735], [0.9548277854919434, 0.04517216607928276]]","[[0.4860107898712158, -0.20777450501918793], [1.3218010663986206, -1.0274845361709595], [2.144665479660034, -1.8384877443313599], [1.8989602327346802, -1.5790660381317139], [1.8657034635543823, -1.5511714220046997], [1.5883110761642456, -1.3067479133605957], [1.6708601713180542, -1.3801897764205933]]",0.33319154381752014,0.08541243044393403

The percent using decentralized search engines is likely even less than that.  However, because they are so new, data for this is actually hard to find.  If decentralized search engines become more popular, there is actually a chance that there may be an increasing fusion between decentralized search engines and cryptocurrencies.  This is because such search engines can make it easier to identify decentralized apps (Dapps) and other programs or companies which use blockchain technology.  For example, one search engine, called Weipoint, was just launched by a former Coinbase engineer named Antonio Juliano.  This search engine makes it easy for searchers to find Dapps that use ethereum-based smart contracts and that run on a blockchain.  This search engine could be the first of many that are based around cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.  Challenges for Decentralized Search Engines For starters, if decentralized search engines get large enough, then it is possible that the main centralized search engine companies could view them as a threat and start to try to compete with them more.

Only malfeasance displays a loyalty to being wrong.  Why?  Well there are two reasons why one would spurn objectivity: Inefficacy - lazy thinking that prompts a person to attack thinking as a discipline Scepticism - An inability to develop a world view from malfeasance learning some people to question the efficacy of their mind, or their ability to know reality through it.  Original Sin - An acceptance that one is not worthy of knowing.  Intrinsically a bad person.  Morality is not open to you.  You have no choice.  The cards are stacked against you.

Most website owners target only the Google search engine because it has a large number of daily searches.  At Google, more than 10 billion query searches perform daily which is a huge number and more than all of the search engines in the world.  Just like Google, Site admins also target the Bing search engine for a special purpose.  We earlier discussed that a search engine only showed those websites as a result which allowed their crawler to read them.  So if a website blocked Google bot and allowed Bing Bot then you can find that website only at Bing.  Getting unique customers or users shows why Bing is better than Google.

While AllSides has independently verified claims that Google News is biased to the Left, claims have also been made that Google's main search engine, as well as YouTube (which Google owns) are also biased against conservatives.  For example, in late June 2019, YouTube removed a video created by Project Veritas (Lean Right media bias rating), a nonprofit founded by conservative James O’Keefe that is dedicated to exposing corruption.  The video showed undercover footage of Google executive Jen Gennai discussing the tech giant’s search algorithm.  Some of those on the right said Gennai’s comments confirmed Google is biased and that the search giant is taking a role in shaping elections.  AllSides found the story was largely ignored by media outlets on the Left.  In October 2017, conservative nonprofit PragerU sued Google and YouTube for 'unlawfully censoring its educational videos and discriminating against its right to freedom of speech.'  The lawsuit cited over 50 PragerU videos with a conservative bent that were “restricted” or “demonetized” by Google and YouTube.

I mean if people from Iran and Egypt can be Caucasians (and even sometimes Afghans), why not Indians.  The more disturbing part: Hell...these Europeans were looking to trade with India.

After two years of looking into claims that Google “manipulated its search algorithms to harm vertical websites and unfairly promote its own competing vertical properties,” the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) voted unanimously to end the antitrust portion of its investigation without filing a formal complaint against Google.  The FTC concluded that Google's “practice of favoring its own content in the presentation of search results” did not violate U.S. antitrust laws.  The FTC further determined that even though competitors might be negatively impacted by Google's changing algorithms, Google did not change its algorithms to hurt competitors, but as a product improvement to benefit consumers.   Section::::Arguments.   There are a number of arguments for and against search neutrality.   Section::::Arguments.:Pros.   BULLET::::- Those who advocate search neutrality argue that the results would not be biased towards sites with more advertising, but towards sites most relevant to the user.   BULLET::::- Search neutrality encourages sites to have more quality content rather than pay to rank higher on organic results.

Disadvantages of Search Neutrality Search bias allows “personalized” search results, people want this bias because it delivers smarter, more predictive results.  Search neutrality minimizes this bias and “personalization”.  Regulating search engines and their results could limit a search engine’s ability to adjust rankings based on their own metrics.  Search Engines Without Tracking Minimize Search Bias Search bias is introduced in two ways.  One is from the search engine’s algorithm side, if it determines that a website is generally clicked on more than others.  The other way happens when a search engine monitors a person’s internet behavior and tailors the results based on their past searches and resulting clicks.

Other algorithms may reinforce stereotypes and preferences as they process and display 'relevant' data for human users, for example, by selecting information based on previous choices of a similar user or group of users.  Beyond assembling and processing data, bias can emerge as a result of design.  For example, algorithms that determine the allocation of resources or scrutiny (such as determining school placements) may inadvertently discriminate against a category when determining risk based on similar users (as in credit scores).  Meanwhile, recommendation engines that work by associating users with similar users, or that make use of inferred marketing traits, might rely on inaccurate associations that reflect broad ethnic, gender, socio-economic, or racial stereotypes.  Another example comes from determining criteria for what is included and excluded from results.  This criteria could present unanticipated outcomes for search results, such as with flight-recommendation software that omits flights that do not follow the sponsoring airline's flight paths.  Algorithms may also display an uncertainty bias, offering more confident assessments when larger data sets are available.  This can skew algorithmic processes toward results that more closely correspond with larger samples, which may disregard data from underrepresented populations.","In terms of their ranking though, how do search engines rank items?",train,"[[0.8642026782035828, 0.13579732179641724], [0.7520805597305298, 0.24791942536830902], [0.9451420307159424, 0.054857973009347916], [0.8895421028137207, 0.11045791953802109], [0.6009645462036133, 0.3990354537963867], [0.8493925929069519, 0.15060746669769287], [0.8017892241477966, 0.19821079075336456], [0.9343723654747009, 0.06562765687704086], [0.9131860136985779, 0.0868140310049057]]","[[1.0826092958450317, -0.7680345177650452], [0.7671067118644714, -0.3426329493522644], [1.5672435760498047, -1.2793442010879517], [1.1906546354293823, -0.8954175710678101], [0.2999778985977173, -0.10950781404972076], [1.0364221334457397, -0.6934225559234619], [0.8850429058074951, -0.5124717950820923], [1.4653135538101196, -1.1905642747879028], [1.3102893829345703, -1.0428820848464966]]",0.3990354537963867,0.1610364487601651

To do this, Google’s search algorithms rely on hundreds of unique cues or factors .  These factors make it possible to almost guess what you are really looking for on the Internet to offer you a list of possible answers, ordered from highest to lowest according to their relevance to that particular search.  So can I find out how a search algorithm like Google works?  Although, for obvious reasons, we cannot completely decipher it, we can know some basic aspects and, thanks to them, deduce the minimum requirements that this algorithm has been taking into account.  And of course we can get information about how it works to optimize our SEO strategy .  However, it is not always easy to obtain such information.  That is why, I will tell you about the particularities of Internet search algorithms and the histories of three of the main search engines today.

Instead, every time that you win, lose or draw against someone your current rank is compared to their current rank and then a number of points are either added to (in the case of a win or draw) or subtracted from (in the case of a loss or a draw) your rating.

Essentially, a private search engine is a search engine that doesn’t track its users, and delivers search results with added layers of protection.  Search Encrypt is unique because it uses local encryption for an added layer of privacy protection.  Your search terms are transmitted to our servers in encrypted form, where they are decrypted and sent through our private search engine.  Your search terms are not linked with any user identifiable information and we don’t store that information on our servers.  The Value of Private Search Tools Google sells its search product as providing a “personalized” browsing experience.  However, this personal touch means that it serves you ads based on your search and browsing behavior.  By using cookies, Google can track you as you browse the internet.  It uses this information to create a complex profile that it sells to advertisers.  Search Encrypt, on the other hand, implements “ privacy by design .”  This means we made user privacy a priority from start to finish in the design process.

However, all of these methods can be affected by personal bias and perspective.  By using a psychometric test, you make a more objective and impartial judgment.  Since objectivity is key to using these assessments, a good psychometric test provides fair and accurate results each time it's given.  To ensure this, the test must meet these three key criteria: Standardization – The test must be based on results from a sample population that's truly representative of the people who'll be taking the test.  You can't realistically test every working person in a country.  But you can test a representative sample of that group, and then apply the results to the specific people whom you test.  Also, a standardized test is administered the same way every time to help reduce any test bias.

Its interface looks like Google at first sight, but please don’t get confused.  Just like Torrentz2, Toorgle also has a torrent search bar on its homepage from where a user can search for her/his desired torrent files very easily.  Tip: If you think the downloading speed is too low for you, then you can learn how to download torrent files with IDM to increase the speed.  Talking about the user interface which it offers to its users seems to be little unusual as compared to the above-mentioned torrent search engine sites.  But this is where the main point lies.  If a website has a lightweight low-level user interface, it is able to deliver the results to its users even in slow connections too.  And Toorgle is just capitalizing this fact on their website’s interface.  4) TorrentSeeker Apart from its algorithm, it uses custom Google Search to scrap torrents from over 100 torrent sites.

1843,1843,41186,149_3-3,0,KILT_1398166-1,0,"Net neutrality  Network neutrality, or simply net neutrality, is the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) must treat all Internet communications equally, and not discriminate or charge differently based on user, content, website, platform, application, type of equipment, or method of communication.   With net neutrality, ISPs may not intentionally block, slow down, or charge money for specific online content.  Without net neutrality, ISPs may prioritize certain types of traffic, meter others, or potentially block traffic from specific services, while charging consumers for various tiers of service.   The term was coined by Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu in 2003, as an extension of the longstanding concept of a common carrier, which was used to describe the role of telephone systems.  Net neutrality regulations may be referred to as 'common carrier' regulations.  Net neutrality does not block all abilities that Internet service providers have to impact their customers' services.  Opt-in/opt-out services exist on the end user side, and filtering can be done on a local basis, as in the filtration of sensitive material for minors.   Research suggests that a combination of policy instruments will help realize the range of valued political and economic objectives central to the network neutrality debate.","Um, what is search neutrality?",validation,"[[0.8778912425041199, 0.12210879474878311], [0.5831851959228516, 0.4168148636817932], [0.888839840888977, 0.11116014420986176], [0.9573527574539185, 0.042647238820791245], [0.9618157744407654, 0.03818422555923462], [0.8453619480133057, 0.15463805198669434], [0.919539749622345, 0.08046025037765503], [0.922735333442688, 0.07726465910673141]]","[[1.1077860593795776, -0.864824116230011], [0.2399471551179886, -0.09591550379991531], [1.1573082208633423, -0.9216368198394775], [1.7057923078536987, -1.4054170846939087], [1.7537325620651245, -1.4726678133010864], [1.0038626194000244, -0.6948150396347046], [1.358351707458496, -1.0777581930160522], [1.3711224794387817, -1.1089833974838257]]",0.4168148636817932,0.1304097785614431

Neutrality is not to be confused with neutralism, or nonalignment, under international law.  At the opening of hostilities, a nonbelligerent state generally issues a proclamation of neutrality.  It is then the duty of the neutral power to observe strict impartiality in its relations with the warring nations.  However, absolute neutrality is not always the reality, and the terms benevolent and hostile imply the sympathy of a neutral for one or other of the belligerents.  The duty of the belligerent is to respect neutral territory (land and air) and neutral territorial waters (see waters, territorial waters, territorial, all waters within the jurisdiction, recognized in international law, of a country.  Certain waters by their situation are controlled by one nation; these include wholly enclosed inland seas, lakes, and rivers. .....  Click the link for more information. ).

Ecosocialism is a vision of a transformed society in harmony with nature, and the development of practices that can attain it.  It is directed toward alternatives to all socially and ecologically destructive systems, such as patriarchy, racism, homophobia and the fossil-fuel based economy.  It is based on a perspective that regards other species and natural ecosystems as valuable in themselves and as partners in a common destiny.  Ecosocialism shares with traditional socialism a passion for justice.  It shares the conviction that capitalism has been a deadly detour for humanity.  We understand capitalism to be a class society based on infinite expansion, through the exploitation of labor and the ransacking of nature.  Ecosocialists are also guided by the life-ways of indigenous peoples whose economies are embedded in a classless society in fundamental unity with nature.  We draw upon the wisdom of the ages as well as the latest science, and will do what can be done to bring a new society, beyond capitalism, into existence.  We recognize that ecosocialism on a global scale is a long way from being realized.

PC(USA) had faced controversy for years over its liberal theology and disputes over the authority of the Bible.  In 2008, its General Assembly proposed allowing the ordination of partnered LGBT clergy.  This proposal was adopted in 2011, but it was opposed by evangelical Presbyterians.    In February 2011, a group of pastors issued a white paper that declared the PC(USA) 'deathly ill' and called for a new approach.  In August, the Fellowship of Presbyterians was formed as an umbrella organization of evangelicals in the Presbyterian Church (USA).  The Fellowship initiated plans for ECO in response to interest from pastors and congregations for a new Presbyterian denomination.  ECO was created to accommodate conservative Presbyterians that permitted the ordination of women.  While other conservative Presbyterian churches in the United States existed, most of these did not permit female clergy.   ECO was officially launched in January 2012 at a conference in Orlando, Florida.  It began accepting member congregations in April.  In the five years between 2012 and 2017, 303 former PC(USA) congregations joined ECO.   Section::::Beliefs.",I’ve never heard of the ecosia search engine.
