It is the method of choice to quantitatively measure amounts of transgene DNA in a food or feed sample. Q-PCR is commonly used to determine whether a DNA sequence is present in a sample and the number of its copies in the sample. The method with currently the highest level of accuracy is quantitative real-time PCR. QRT-PCR methods use fluorescent dyes, such as Sybr Green, or fluorophore-containing DNA probes, such as TaqMan, to measure the amount of amplified product in real time.

Multiplex PCR uses multiple, unique primer sets within a single PCR reaction to produce amplicons of varying sizes specific to different DNA sequences, i.e. different transgenes. By targeting multiple genes at once, additional information may be gained from a single test run that otherwise would require several times the reagents and more time to perform.

Even though detecting a novel gene in a GMO can be like finding a needle in a haystack, the fact that the needles are usually similar makes it much easier. To trigger gene expression, scientists couple the gene they want to add with what is known as a transcription promoter. The high-performing 35S promoter is a common feature to many GMOs. In addition, the stop signal for gene transcription in most GMOs is often the same: the NOS terminator. Researchers now compile a set of genetic sequences characteristic of GMOs. After genetic elements characteristic of GMOs are selected, methods and tools are developed for detecting them in test samples. Approaches being considered include microarrays and anchor PCR profiling.",1,1,1

The group were strongly opposed to commercial bootlegging and policed stores that sold them, while the saturation of tapes among fans suppressed any demand for product. In 1985, the Dead, after years of tolerance, officially endorsed live taping of their shows, and set up dedicated areas that they believed gave the best sound recording quality.

83_1,What are some interesting facts about bees?,CAR_23c3b79994286a1b89dbc6cf83c1c4687a024955,"Bumble bees are generally host to a diversity of parasitoids in which the larvae grows inside the living host. The majority of parasitoids for bumble bees are flies and about 30 percent or more bees within the area can be infected. The process of parasitism consists of the fly attaching to the bee in flight and inserting her oviposits between the terga of the bee. The larval fly hatches within the bee host and develops by feeding on the host’s tissues. The bee lives for about two weeks before dying. The fly then pupates and spends the winter inside the bee, fully developed, before it emerges the following year. North American bumblebees are also hosted by one parasitoid wasp and the moth, B. variabilis.  Hibernating queen bumble bees are parasitized by a nematode worm, Sphaerularia bombi. This parasite does not reduce life span, but instead causes the sterilization of the queen. It has been observed that affected queens forage two to three weeks later than those that are unaffected.  Parasitic microorganisms also use bees as their host. Parasitic microorganisms’ effects may be lethal or sublethal. Pathogens may be transmitted within a colony or the bee may be infected at flowers. Tracheal mites (Locustacarus buchneri) leads to reduced foraging efficiency by living in the bee’s alveoli. Certain protozoans and fungi consume the host tissue or gut substances of the bumble bee’s digestive tract, decreasing foraging efficiency, life span, and thus the colony fitness. Bees may contain symbiotic bacteria that offer some immunity to pathogens. Further exposure to habitat loss as well as pesticide exposure may lead to bee predisposition, thus promoting the species’ decay.",1,1,1

One example of such compromises was welfare reform legislation signed into law in 1996. The new law required welfare recipients to work as a condition of benefits and imposed limits on how long individuals may receive payments, but did allow states to exempt 20% of their caseloads from the time limits. Clinton also pursued tough federal anti-crime measures, steering more federal dollars toward the war on drugs, and calling for the hiring of 100,000 new police officers. Compromise came with difficulty, though, as the parties failed to agree on a budget, causing the federal government to shut down in late 1995 into early 1996.

Bikepacking is similar to bike touring, however the two sports generally use different bikes and the main difference is the method of carrying gear.  Bikepacking generally involves carrying less gear and using smaller frame bags while bike touring will use panniers.  A typical bikepacking set-up includes a frame bag, handlebar roll, seat pack, and backpack and typical gear includes lightweight and basic camping gear, and a bike repair kit.  Mountain bikes are generally used as many bike packing destinations are reached via forest-service roads or singletrack trails.  Mountain bikes specific to bike-packing use a slightly taller frame to get the maximum frame bag capacity.  This is achieved by using a longer headtube, a more horizontal top tube, and a reduced stem degree.  Generally, bikepackers tend to cover anywhere from 25 to 75 miles (40 – 120 km) in a given day as the riding can be technical.  Risks Injuries are a given factor when mountain biking, especially in the more extreme disciplines like downhill biking, free ride and dirt jumping.",1,Partial answer: Bikepacking generally involves carrying less gear and using smaller frame bags while bike touring will use panniers.,1

You can push your bike more easily Panniers get in the way and hit your leg when pushing.  This isn’t a problem with bikepacking bags because they don’t stick out off the frame.  This comes in handy if you ride in places where you need to do a lot of hike and bike.  This is one of the main reasons that bikepacking bags are designed the way they are.  Bikepacking bags are trendy right now For most riders, this doesn’t really matter.  If you care about using the most modern gear, bikepacking bags are it right now.  Bikepacking Bags Cons Many bikepackers chose to wear a small backpack Bikepacking bags have less carrying capacity Generally, bikepacking bags can carry less volume than panniers.  For example, an average handlebar bag can hold 15-20 liters, a frame bag 10-15 liters, and a seat bag 10-25 liters.

For instance, Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom in 2003 showed in his influential paper that the possibility of simulation theory could be at least in one of three scenarios, as reported by Vox: All of the human-like civilizations have gone extinct before reaching a technological maturity capable of running simulated realities.  If, by chance, some civilizations survived and reached the phase of technological maturity, not one of them is interested in creating simulated realities.  Civilizations that reached technological maturity would be so advanced that they have created multiple simulations and not just one.  But scientists who study the simulation theory still does not know which of these three possibilities is correct.  Bostrom concludes that the third option may be the most probable outcome.

In this case the embrace may be allowed to open briefly, to permit execution of the complex footwork.  The complex figures of this style became the basis for a theatrical performance style of tango seen in the touring stage shows.  For stage purposes, the embrace is often open, and the complex footwork is augmented with gymnastic lifts, kicks, and drops.  A newer style sometimes called tango nuevo or 'new tango', has been popularized in recent years by a younger generation of dancers.  The embrace is often quite open and very elastic, permitting the leader to lead a large variety of very complex figures.

Immigrants from Europe - Italy, Spain, Britain, Poland, Russia, Germany and every other European country mixed with earlier generation of settlers of all races from other South American countries.  They brought their native music and dances with them, and continued to assimilate new innovations from abroad.  Traditional polkas, waltzes and mazurkas were mixed with the popular Habanera from Cuba and the spanish seaboard, to form a new dance and music, the milonga, which was popular in the 1870s .  This was known as the 'poor man's Habanera'.  The word tango was used at the time to describe various music and dances, for example the ' tango andaluza ' from Spain in the 1880s.",1,0,0

Charles Ponzi took investors for $10 million by promising 40 percent returns from arbitrage profits on International Postal Reply Coupons.  In a Ponzi scheme, the underlying investment claims are usually entirely fictional; very few, if any, actual physical assets or investments generally exist.  As the number of total investors grows and the supply of potential new investors dwindles, there is not enough money to pay off promised returns and cover investors who try to cash out.  A Ponzi bubble will burst when the con artist simply cannot keep up with the payments investors are expecting to receive.  When the scheme collapses (as it always does), investors may lose their entire investment in the fraud.  In many cases, the perpetrator will have spent investment money on personal expenses, depleting funds and accelerating the bursting of the bubble.

How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Ponzi Schemes?  Experts disagree as to whether Ponzi schemes are pyramid schemes.  Certainly, there are similarities between the two.  While Ponzi schemes are certainly fraudulent, they are not necessarily hierarchical in nature, which is one of the defining characteristics of the pyramid scheme.  Additionally, in a Ponzi scheme, “investors” are not asked to recruit others, nor are they told where their payoff would come from.  In this sense, Ponzi schemes operate at a level that is vaguer than the traditional pyramid scheme.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Multi-Level Marketing?

The company SpaceX is developing the technologies over a number of years to facilitate full and rapid reusability of space launch vehicles.  The project's long-term objectives include returning a launch vehicle first stage to the launch site in minutes and to return a second stage to the launch pad following orbital realignment with the launch site and atmospheric reentry in up to 24 hours.  SpaceX's long term goal is that both stages of their orbital launch vehicle will be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return.   The program was publicly announced in 2011.  SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015.  The first re-flight of a landed first stage occurred in March 2017 with the second occurring in June 2017, that one only five months after the maiden flight of the booster.  The third attempt occurred in October 2017 with the SES-11/EchoStar-105 mission.  Second flights of refurbished first stages then became routine.

This was consistent with Musk's strategic statement in 2012 that 'The revolutionary breakthrough will come with rockets that are fully and rapidly reusable.  We will never conquer Mars unless we do that.  It'll be too expensive.  The American colonies would never have been pioneered if the ships that crossed the ocean hadn't been reusable.'

The tests were to be run in Texas at the McGregor Rocket Test Facility in 2014–2015.

There are many secondary effects of climate change and sea level rise particular to island nations.  According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service climate change in the Pacific Islands will cause 'continued increases in air and ocean surface temperatures in the Pacific, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and increased rainfall during the summer months and a decrease in rainfall during the winter months'.  This would entail distinct changes to the small, diverse, and isolated island ecosystems and biospheres present within many of these island nations.  As sea level rises island nations are at increased risk of losing coastal arable land to degradation as well as salinification.  Once the limited available soil on these islands is salinified it becomes very difficult to produce subsistence crops such as breadfruit.  This would severely impact the agricultural and commercial sector in nations such as the Marshall Islands and Kiribati.  In addition, local fisheries would also be severely affected by higher ocean temperatures and increased ocean acidification.  As ocean temperatures rise and the pH of oceans decreases, many fish and other marine species would die out or change their habits and range.

The agreement differs from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the last widely adopted amendment to the UNFCCC, in that no annexes are established to lessen responsibility of developing nations.  Rather, emissions targets for each nation were separately negotiated and are to be voluntarily enforced, leading United States officials to regard the Paris Agreement as an executive agreement rather than a legally binding treaty.  This removed the requirement for the United States Congress to ratify the agreement.  In April 2016, the United States became a signatory to the Paris Agreement, and accepted it by executive order in September 2016.  President Obama committed the United States to contributing US$3 billion to the Green Climate Fund.  The Fund has set itself a goal of raising $100 billion a year by 2020.

Structure The Paris Agreement has a 'bottom up' structure in contrast to most international environmental law treaties, which are 'top down', characterized by standards and targets set internationally, for states to implement.  Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on consensus building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets.  The specific climate goals are thus politically encouraged, rather than legally bound.  Only the processes governing the reporting and review of these goals are mandated under international law.  This structure is especially notable for the United States—because there are no legal mitigation or finance targets, the agreement is considered an 'executive agreement rather than a treaty'.  Because the UNFCCC treaty of 1992 received the consent of the US Senate, this new agreement does not require further legislation from Congress.  Another key difference between the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol is their scope.

To that end, greater flexibility and national ownership is built into the Paris Agreement: No language is included about the commitments countries should make; nations can set their own emissions targets (NDCs) consistent with their level of development and technological advancement.  While the Paris Agreement doesn’t have harsh penalties for countries not meeting their targets, it does have a robust system of monitoring, reporting, and reassessing individual and collective country targets over time in order to move the world closer to the broader objectives of the deal.

The approach being taken in UK beekeeping is to raise the profile of integrated bee health management, in other words identifying and trying to eliminate factors which reduce the health status of a colony. This incorporates increasing the skill level of beekeepers through training and education, raising the profile of habitat destruction and its effect of forage (nectar and pollen) availability, and of course research on the incidence and distribution of diseases and conditions in the UK together with more applied research and development on providing solutions.'",0,1,1

This arrangement led to inefficiencies due to the inherent conflicts of interest that the four partner companies faced; they were both GIE shareholders of, and subcontractors to, the consortium. The companies collaborated on development of the Airbus range, but guarded the financial details of their own production activities and sought to maximise the transfer prices of their sub-assemblies. It was becoming clear that Airbus was no longer a temporary collaboration to produce a single plane as per its original mission statement, it had become a long term brand for the development of further aircraft. By the late 1980s work had begun on a pair of new medium-sized aircraft, the biggest to be produced at this point under the Airbus name, the Airbus A330 and the Airbus A340.In the early 1990s the then Airbus CEO Jean Pierson argued that the GIE should be abandoned and Airbus established as a conventional company. However, the difficulties of integrating and valuing the assets of four companies, as well as legal issues, delayed the initiative. In December 1998, when it was reported that British Aerospace and DASA were close to merging, Aérospatiale paralysed negotiations on the Airbus conversion; the French company feared the combined BAe/DASA, which would own 57.9% of Airbus, would dominate the company and it insisted on a 50/50 split. However, the issue was resolved in January 1999 when BAe abandoned talks with DASA in favour of merging with Marconi Electronic Systems to become BAE Systems. Then in 2000 three of the four partner companies (DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, successor to Deutsche Airbus; Aérospatiale-Matra, successor to Sud-Aviation; and CASA) merged to form EADS, simplifying the process.

As large-scale information systems become more common, there is so much information stored in many databases worldwide that an individual has no practical means of knowing of or controlling all of the information about themselves that others may have hold or access. Such information could potentially be sold to others for profit and/or be used for purposes not known to or sanctioned by the individual concerned. The concept of information privacy has become more significant as more systems controlling more information appear. Also the consequences of privacy violations can be more severe. Privacy law in many countries has had to adapt to changes in technology in order to address these issues and, to some extent, maintain privacy rights. But the existing global privacy rights framework has also been criticized as incoherent and inefficient.

That the current trading system encourages companies to sell carbon emissions allowances they would not normally use.  Meaning that wealthy companies that go over their allowance find it fairly easy and economical to pollute more if they choose to.  The point of this argument is that the current trading system does not work.  Wealthy companies will just buy more carbon credits and ignore their quota.  So, wouldn’t a different system be better?

Do more compound exercises.  They work out more muscle groups in a single move, thus burning more calories and building stronger muscles.  Great examples of such exercises include barbell deadlifts, squats, dumbbell bench press, dumbbell walking lunges, kettlebell squats press, and pullups.  2  .  Keep your heart rate up.

While the ‘number of calories burned’ metric shouldn’t be the sole reason you pursue a workout or activity – moving your body, getting your heart pumping, and working your muscles is incredibly beneficial for both your physical and mental health and wellbeing – you likely still want to know you’re getting a little extra something out of that 30-minute sweat sesh.

137_1-3,Which of Bostrom's 'simulation argument' trilemma is most likely?,MARCO_31_719719292-1,"Review of Bostrom's Simulation Argument Brian Eggleston In “Are you living in a computer simulation?”, Nick Bostrom presents a probabilistic analysis of the possibility that we might all be living in a computer simulation.  He concludes that it is not only possible, but rather probable that we are living in a computer simulation.  This argument, originally published in 2001, shook up the field of philosophical ontology, and forced the philosophical community to rethink the way it conceptualizes “natural” laws and our own intuitions regarding our existence.  Is it possible that all of our ideas about the world in which we live are false, and are simply the result of our own desire to believe that we are “real”?  Even more troubling, if we are living in a computer simulation, is it possible that the simulation might be shut off at any moment?  In this paper, I plan to do two things.  First, I hope to consider what conclusions we might draw from Bostrom’s argument, and what implications this might have for how we affect our lives.  Second, I plan to discuss a possible objection to Bostrom’s argument, and how this might affect our personal probability for the possibility that we are living in a computer simulation.",0,0,0
137_1-3,Which of Bostrom's 'simulation argument' trilemma is most likely?,MARCO_31_719719292-4,"This principle, when applied to the case of simulation, says that the probability that we are living in a simulated world instead of a real one is equal to the fraction of all people that are actually simulated people. By reviewing the probability assignments that Bostrom has just given, it becomes clear that several things have to be the case.  Because the number of simulations run by a civilization capable of running them would be very great, if simulations are done, then the number of people that are simulated would be much greater than the number of people that are not simulated, which would mean that the probability that we are living in a simulated universe is almost unity.  So, it becomes clear that one of two things must be the case.  Either the probability that simulations are run is very small (practically null), or it is almost certain that we ourselves are living in a simulation.  Bostrom asserts that, because we have no reason to believe that either of these possibilities is more likely than the other, we have no reason to change the way we live our lives because of this argument.  However, this isn’t quite accurate.",0,1,1

Some even argue that the human mind could be a simulation.  Here’s Andrew Zimmerman Jones, writing for The Nature of Reality : In 2003, philosopher Nick Bostrom of the University of Oxford made the first rigorous exploration of the simulation argument.  The simulations he considered are different from those in movies like “The Matrix,” in which the world is simulated but the conscious minds are not—that is, where biological human beings with human brains interface with the simulated world.  In Bostrom’s simulations, human consciousness is just another figment of the simulation.  Bostrom assumes that the human mind is substrate-independent: that human consciousness isn’t strictly dependent on the biological brain itself, and that if we could physically replicate that brain in sufficient detail in another form (such as within a computer) it would also have the subjective experience of consciousness.  The replication doesn’t have to be perfect.  It just has to be good enough that the replicated being has a human-like subjective experience (a “mind”).  An advanced civilization with sufficient computing power to pull this off would be classified as “posthuman.”",0,1,1

However, there might be good reasons for thinking that we actually live in a computer simulation (Bostrom 2003), and if we lend some credence to radical skeptical scenarios, this may have consequences for how we act  (Schwitzgebel 2017).  Even purely hypothetical skeptical scenarios may enhance their psychological force by capitalizing on the analogy with dreams.  Clark  (2005) argues that the Matrix contains elements of “industrial-strength deception” in which both sensory experience and intellectual functioning are exactly the same as in standard wake-states, whereas other aspects are more similar to the compromised reasoning and bizarre shifts that are the hallmark of dreams.  1.4 Descartes’ solution to the dream problem and real-world dreams At the end of the Sixth Meditation, Descartes suggests a solution to the dream problem that is tied to a reassessment of what it is like to dream.  Contrary to his remarks in the First Meditation, he notes that dreams are only rarely connected to waking memories and are often discontinuous, as when dream characters suddenly appear or disappear.",0,1,1

Some philosophers disagree, proposing that perhaps 'Sims' do not have conscious experiences the same way that unsimulated humans do, or that it can otherwise be self-evident to a human that they are a human rather than a Sim.  Philosopher Barry Dainton modifies Bostrom's trilemma by substituting 'neural ancestor simulations' (ranging from literal brains in a vat, to far-future humans with induced high-fidelity hallucinations that they are their own distant ancestors) for Bostrom's 'ancestor simulations', on the grounds that every philosophical school of thought can agree that sufficiently high-tech neural ancestor simulation experiences would be indistinguishable from non-simulated experiences.  Even if high-fidelity computer Sims are never conscious, Dainton's reasoning leads to the following conclusion: either the fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage and are able and willing to run large numbers of neural ancestor simulations is close to zero, or we are in some kind of (possibly neural) ancestor simulation.",0,0,0

In this way, C’est la vie really might be the appropriate overall French response to tragedy, whether you think the phrase is about feeling like this is how it is and there’s nothing we can do, or saying “This is how it is, now let’s move on and not let bad things stop us from living.”  Alysa Salzberg Alysa Salzberg is an American writer, worrier, teacher, and cookie enthusiast who has lived in Paris, France, for more than a decade.",0,0.

In recent years, scientists have become interested in testing the theory.  In 2012, inspired by Professor Bostrom’s work, physicists at the University of Washington proposed an empirical experiment of the simulation hypothesis.  The details are complex, but the basic idea is simple: Some of today’s computer simulations of our cosmos produce distinctive anomalies — for example, there are telltale glitches in the behavior of simulated cosmic rays.  By taking a closer look at the cosmic rays in our universe, the physicists suggested, we might detect comparable anomalies, providing evidence that we live in a simulation.  Similar experiments were proposed in 2017 and 2018.  Professor Smoot captured the promise of these proposals when he declared, “You are a simulation and physics can prove it.”  So far, none of these experiments has been conducted, and I hope they never will be.  Indeed, I am writing to warn that conducting these experiments could be a catastrophically bad idea — one that could cause the annihilation of our universe.  Think of it this way.

In 1880s Boston, Sarah Howe offered female investors a chance to make money in the Ladies Deposit.  She garnered half a million dollars from more than a thousand women, using some of the funds to pay off other investors and pocketing the rest.  A couple of decades later, William Franklin Miller came along and tried the scheme again to even bigger success.  He promised unheard-of returns, and when he came through on his promises, more investors poured in, handing over a million dollars in total before he was exposed [  source: Zuckoff ].  In Miller's case, the victims were so thrilled by the success of their investments that they chose to reinvest their earnings in his scheme [  source: Zuckoff ].  Clearly, Ponzi wasn't the first to implement the scheme, and he wasn't the last -- not by a long shot.  Since his stunt in 1920, many Ponzi schemes have been exposed around the world.

Get started today » One of the concerns I’ve seen aimed at Bitcoin is the claim that it’s a Ponzi scheme.  The argument suggests that because the Bitcoin network is continually reliant on new people buying in, that eventually it will collapse in price as new buyers are exhausted.  So, this article takes a serious look at the concern by comparing and contrasting Bitcoin to systems that have Ponzi-like characteristics, to see if the claim holds up.  The short answer is that Bitcoin does not meet the definition of a Ponzi scheme in either narrow or broad sense, but let’s dive in to see why that’s the case.  Defining a Ponzi Scheme To start with tackling the topic of Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme, we need a definition.  Here is how the US Securities and Exchange Commission defines one: A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors.  Ponzi scheme organizers often promise to invest your money and generate high returns with little or no risk.  But in many Ponzi schemes, the fraudsters do not invest the money.  Instead, they use it to pay those who invested earlier and may keep some for themselves.",0,1,1

Initially a promising young actress, Spitzeder became a well-known private banker in 19th-century Munich when her theatrical success dwindled.  Running what was possibly the first recorded Ponzi scheme, she offered large returns on investments by continually using the money of new investors to pay back the previous ones.  At the height of her success, Spitzeder was estimated to be the wealthiest woman in Bavaria.   Opening her bank in 1869, Spitzeder managed to fend off attempts to discredit her for a few years before authorities were able to bring her to trial in 1872.  Because Ponzi schemes were not yet illegal, she was convicted instead of bad accounting and mishandling customers' money and sentenced to three years in prison.  Her bank was closed and 32,000 people lost 38 million gulden, the equivalent of almost 400 million euros in 2017 money, causing a wave of suicides.

Another popular breakfast item is the pao de queijo, a stuffed bread roll made from tapioca flour and filled with melted cheese.  You can find the pao de queijo throughout Rio, but the most famous franchise is Casa de Pao de Queijo where the pao de queijo always tastes flaky and hot.

Argentineans love beef.  In fact in Buenos Aires many locals eat beef a dozen times a week.  So great is their respect for this noble meat that no Argentinean would ever dream of marinating it or of seasoning it with anything other than salt.  Still, two condiments are commonly served with grilled meats: a gusty parsley-garlic sauce called chimichurri and a robust relish called salsa criolla.  The former is a cross between pesto and vinaigrette, made with fragrant fresh flat-leaf parsley and a nose-blasting dose of garlic.  (Don't worry about bad breath: the parsley acts as a breath freshener.)  Salsa criolla combines tomatoes, onions and peppers.As in North America, a typical Argentinean steak house would serve baked potatoes or french fries.

BFR Launch The BFR or Big Falcon Rocket is next after Falcon Heavy.  Elon said that BFR might be ready for “short hopper flights with the spaceship part”.  So taking this statement into account we can make an assumption that after the Heavy Falcon, the Big Falcon Rocket of BFR is next.  The Earth to Earth flights that Elon announced in late 2017 is also said to happen with the BFR.  So, we can expect a test launch of BFR within 2018.",0,1,1

The integrated second-stage-with-spaceship design has not been used in previous launch vehicles.   Section::::Operational flow.   In the first year of successful stage return from the experimental test flights, SpaceX performed 'ad hoc' and flight-specific evaluation and component testing on each successfully landed stage.  Stages were processed and initially evaluated in either launch hangars, or for Cape Canaveral landings, in the new hangar SpaceX recently completed at Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39.  Returned rocket parts have also been transported to SpaceX Hawthorne and SpaceX McGregor for engineering evaluation and testing.   In February 2017, after eight rocket cores had successfully landed — seven of them having launched from Cape Canaveral — SpaceX announced plans to expand their physical facilities to process and refurbish rockets.  They will do so in both leased space and in a new building to be built in Port Canaveral, Florida, near the location where the Atlantic Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship is berthed, and where stages that land on the east-coast droneship are now removed from the ship.

146_1-3,What are bike packing bags?,MARCO_48_1491483192-5,"We also liked the zippered outside pockets and mesh side panels for even more organization-centric storage. Two Wheel Gear says this bag is made of 600-denier TPE-coated polyester (so water will roll off of it), but it comes with a rain cover for true downpours.  The company offers a two-year limited warranty against defects in craftsmanship.  Flaws but not dealbreakers: The rain flaps that cover the zippers are very stiff, almost to a point of frustration.  We were often left wrestling with zippers caught at weird angles.  That said, we don’t think that’s a good enough reason not to buy this bag if you like everything else about it.  This bag may not be large enough if you want to carry along a lot of extras such as lunch and a change of clothes.  Two Wheel Gear does make a bigger bag, the Pannier Backpack Convertible Plus+, which is 30 L and would be the right size if that’s your goal.

See it on Amazon Loading 2.  The Avengers The Avengers marks the first time Earth's Mightiest Heroes banded together to fight a common enemy.  This movie is the true launching point for much of what's unfolded since in the MCU.  Not to mention that it technically showcased the first conflict between the Avengers and Thanos's forces, though that fact wasn't made clear until the mid-credits scene.  Perhaps most importantly, The Avengers hinges on Loki's efforts to steal the Tesseract and acquire it for Thanos.  That story finally came full circle in Infinity War.  See it on Amazon 3.  Thor: The Dark World While not generally regarded as one of the better MCU movies, Thor: The Dark World makes one important contribution by introducing another Infinity Stone, the Reality Stone, found in the destructive weapon known as the Aether.  This film also sets the stage for the downfall of Asgard in later MCU movies, ending with Odin being betrayed and replaced by his adopted son, Loki.

They have so much influence thx to their movies that they’re literally able to just have a small hint of a new character in the MCU or new idea and literally EVERYONE will know about it and most of them will do their research such as what most of us did when Moon Knight was announced, frankly it doesn’t matter how many years DC spends spamming Batman and Superman because Marvel can literally just make characters apart of the MCU and they’re high B list characters in fame for being in the MCU alone, and factor that in with the A-listers some of them become later on lots Iron Man Captain America and Hulk for example and DC’s a little outgunned in terms of iconic characters, which actually brings me to my next point… #4-  No character over reliance problem Ok ok I get it DC and it’s fans Batman and Superman are super popular superheroes, it’s still a problem that those 2 are the only projects DC’s really focused on for the vast 99% of the time!",0,0,0
147_1-7,Let’s talk about Captain America The Winter Soldier’s far-reaching implications for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.,MARCO_27_1437746853-7,"It could be said that Doctor Strange and Thanos only use the stone's power to rewind a certain element of the current timeline, and this therefore won't create a separate divergent world like changing the past usually would. This is certainly open to debate and remains unaddressed in the MCU at present, but the Ancient One does seem to imply that any sort of meddling with the timeline can create splits in the natural flow and use of the Time Stone certainly falls into this category.  Problematically, it clearly wasn't the intention of the Russo brothers ' or of writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely to imply that Scarlet Witch beat Thanos in a different timeline and several inconsistencies emerge as a result.  If using the Time Stone to rewrite Vision's death created a separate timeline, would that new plane of reality have its own set of Infinity Stones?  This was certainly the case when the Avengers traveled back through the Quantum Realm.  Additionally, if Thanos jumped from the reality with a destroyed Mind Stone to another, would that world not have its own version of Thanos?  The possibilities and implications are, like the Multiverse itself, seemingly endless and are an expected consequence of Avengers: Endgame 's reliance on time travel.",0,0,0

Speaking with a reporter at a fan event in Shanghai, Kevin Feige was asked about Spider-Man: Far From Home.  As always, Feige is secretive in his response, but the little he did say will make fans sit up and take note. '  It's the end of the third phase, ' he observed. '  You're the first one I've told that to. '  This makes perfect sense in terms of the overall narrative of the MCU.  Avengers: Endgame is the climax of the MCU to date, an event movie that's frankly unparalleled in the history of cinema.  While Thanos is sure to be defeated, there will be massive consequences for Marvel's entire shared universe, and Spider-Man: Far From Home is set to explore these.  Feige's comments essentially turn the next Spider-Man movie into an extended epilogue for Avengers: Endgame.  Fans generally assume that each MCU phase will end with an Avengers film, but that's not necessarily the case.  It's true that Phase 1 ended with The Avengers, but that was largely because Marvel was taking a gamble with the whole shared universe model at that time; had The Avengers failed, the whole idea would have fallen apart.",0,0,0

But who could be part of this team?  Here’s the female Avengers cast as we know it: Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel was the first female superhero in the MCU to get her own solo movie, so she would definitely be included in an all-female Avengers movie.  Captain Marvel worked closely with the heroes who survived Thanos' snap, but Avengers: Endgame failed to show more of her by sending her on a separate mission in outer space while the Avengers, Rocket Raccoon, Nebula, and Scott Lang found a way to make the time heist happen.  Captain Marvel showed up right on time during the Battle of Earth and was close to defeating Thanos, but the Mad Titan had some tricks up his sleeve.  The last time viewers saw Captain Marvel was at Tony Stark’s funeral, and she will return for a second solo movie before another team-up.  Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts/Rescue Pepper Potts got a major upgrade when she put on the Rescue armor in Avengers: Endgame, which allowed her to fight alongside Iron Man and the rest of the MCU.",0,0,0

Author: Natacha Medeiros Updated: Jan 25, 2019 Original: Jan 7, 2014 pinterest-pin-it Last year, I did the scariest thing I've ever done: I graduated from university.  While it's the most amazing feeling to be finished with school (and have a kick-ass degree under my belt), I've had to face the reality of looking for, dare I say it, a career.  That means growing up, but even worse, going to job interviews—OMG.  Before my first one, I obsessed not only about having flushed cheeks, a dry mouth and a racing heart, but also about picking the perfect outfit and equally perfect beauty look.  Needless to say, I was NERVOUS.  The morning of the interview, I swiped on my favourite red lipstick, MAC's Ronnie Red.  As I was ready about an hour too early (I am the queen of punctuality and proud of it!), I had a lot of time to sit and ponder my makeup.  'Are red lips too much?'  I found myself wondering.  I mean, I thought I looked good.",0,0,0

Can you tell me a little bit about the evaluation process at your company?  What are the common attributes of people who really excel at your company?  What are a few things that really drive results for your company?  If I were to be hired, what do you expect me to accomplish in the position?  What has been your favorite part of working at this company?  What are the major clients in your office?  What is the next step in the interviewing process?  Following Up Following up after your interview is extremely important and sets you apart from others being interviewed.  When you are selling something, it is important to have as many touchpoints with the potential clients/customers/buyers as possible, while maintaining the three principles above and not being weird.  It is no different when it comes to selling yourself to a potential employer.  Connect with your interviewer the same day, right after the interview, through LinkedIn.  LinkedIn is a great networking tool!  So, after the interview, sit down for 15 or 30 minutes and craft a great follow-up email.  Need an example?  Dear Sally, Good morning!  I would like to thank you again for the interview yesterday.",0,1,1

Now you are at the stage where it is time to install electrical systems in the building.  You also have procured this task.  The contractor comes and does their part, and you release them by paying the agreed amount of money, and you close the contract.  Afterward, carpentry and painting work starts.  You also have procured these jobs.  Once these contractors complete their tasks, you make payment and then you close these contracts as well.  The building is ready, so you call the client to come and inspect it.  Once the client is satisfied, they accept the building, sign the acceptance letter, and all pending payments are released.  Once you get the payment, you update the lessons learned, and release the team and resources.  Finally, you close the project.  So, it’s evident in this example that the close procurement process is performed many times, but the close project is performed only once—at the end of the project.  Some Key Points Please note the following: The close procurement process must happen before the close project or close phase process.  The close procurement process may occur many times during the project ’s life cycle, but the close project process will be performed only once at the end of the project.",0,0,0

After each set of interviews, start revising your canvas.  I went through more than 30 lean canvases before writing a line of code for Alumnify.  After that, make wireframes.  When we were starting out, we went with Balsamiq, which is simple and gives you a free trial.  Then take your wireframes and show them to as many customers as possible to get feedback.  Don't stop until you have 100 more interviews.  Great, now we have an idea of who our customer is and what we need to build for a minimum viable product.  Note that we did the Customer Discovery phase without any money or development experience.  Step 2: Learn the basics of development.  Start using Codecademy, Treehouse's free trial, or Code.org for two hours a day for about a month.  It won't make you a CTO, but you'll start learning the basics of coding.  Even having some understanding of what a developer does will help you be a better recruiter for your tech co-founder.
