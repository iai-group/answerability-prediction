Both simple and highly integrated multiple systems are experiencing an extraordinary growth in the use of computers and software to monitor and/or control safety-critical subsystems or functions. A software specification error, design flaw, or the lack of generic safety-critical requirements can contribute to or cause a system failure or erroneous human decision. To achieve an acceptable level of safety for software used in critical applications, software system safety engineering must be given primary emphasis early in the requirements definition and system conceptual design process. Safety-critical software must then receive continuous management emphasis and engineering analysis throughout the development and operational lifecycles of the system.Software system safety is directly related to the more critical design aspects and safety attributes in software and system functionality, whereas software quality attributes are inherently different and require standard scrutiny and development rigor. Level of Rigor (LOR) is a graded approach to software quality and software design assurance as a pre-requisite that a suitable software process is followed for confidence. LOR concepts and standards such as DO-178C are NOT a substitute for software safety. Software safety per IEEE STD-1228 and MIL-STD-882E focuses on ensuring explicit safety requirements are met and verified using functional approaches from a safety requirements analysis and test perspective. Software safety hazard analysis required for more complex systems where software is controlling critical functions generally are in the following sequential categories and are conducted in phases as part of the system safety or safety engineering process: software safety requirements analysis; software safety design analyses (top level, detailed design and code level); software safety test analysis, and software safety change analysis. Once these 'functional' software safety analyses are completed the software engineering team will know where to place safety emphasis and what functional threads, functional paths, domains and boundaries to focus on when designing in software safety attributes to ensure correct functionality and to detect malfunctions, failures, faults and to implement a host of mitigation strategies to control hazards. Software security and various software protection technologies are similar to software safety attributes in the design to mitigate various types of threats vulnerability and risks.

NetHacks major deviations from Hack were the introduction of a wider variety of monsters, borrowing from other mythologies and lores, including anachronistic and contemporary cultural elements (such as a tourist class with a flash-bulb camera inspired by Terry Pratchett's Discworld series) in the high fantasy setting, and the use of pre-defined levels with some procedural elements that the player would encounter deeper in the dungeons. Further iterations of the game included branching pathways through the dungeon and optional character-based quests that could grant the player an extremely useful item to complete the game. Though the DevTeam released the code publicly, they carefully maintained who could contribute to the code base to avoid excessive forking of the vanilla game, and remain relatively quiet about suggested improvements to each release, working in relatively secrecy from its player base.

All EU member states are party to both organisations through international treaties. The Treaty on European Union article 6(2) required the EU to accede to the ECHR, but would 'not affect the Union's competences as defined in the Treaties'. This was thought necessary before the Treaty of Lisbon 2007 to ensure that the EU gave adequate protection to human rights, overseen by the external European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. However, in Opinion 2/13, after a request by the Commission to review their plan to accede, the Court of Justice (in Luxembourg) produced a five main reasons why it felt that the accession agreement as it stood was incompatible with the treaties. The reasoning was regarded by a majority of commentators as thinly veiled attempt of the Court of Justice to clutch onto its own power, but it has meant the Commission is redrafting a new accession agreement. Under TEU articles 3(5), 21, 34 and 42, the EU must also respect the principles of the United Nations Charter.

Although female worker bees do possess ovaries and can essentially produce viable eggs, this potential is almost never realized as long as the colony is ruled by a dominant queen. Therefore, the probability of personal reproduction by a worker bee is exceedingly low. “Worker policing,” which is the mutual prevention of reproduction by workers, could be the reason behind the conscious non-reproduction of female worker bees. In other words, their fertility is controlled by queen signals. The queen honeybee informs workers of her presence by pheromones that she secretes from her mandibular glands. These signals are acquired by workers in close vicinity of the queen and then spread to other workers in the colony, mainly by body contacts. In presence of queen pheromone signals, the vast majority of workers refrain from activating their ovaries. Therefore, due to factors of genetic relatedness, Apis cerana often try to prevent other workers in her colony from reproducing, either by destroying worker-laid eggs, or by showing aggression towards workers attempting to lay eggs through worker policing.",Why doesn't honey spoil?,train

In practice though, many startups are initially funded by the founders themselves using 'bootstrapping', in which loans or monetary gifts from friends and family are combined with savings and credit card debt to finance the venture. Factoring is another option, though it is not unique to startups. Other funding opportunities include various forms of crowdfunding, for example equity crowdfunding, in which the startup seeks funding from a large number of individuals, typically by pitching their idea on the Internet",Tell me more about angel investment rounds.,train

While negative, having some experience with mistrust allows the infant to gain an understanding of what constitutes dangerous situations later in life, yet being at the stage of infant or toddler; it is a good idea not to put them in situations of mistrust, the child's number one needs are to feel safe, comforted, and well cared for.",What are some good examples of successful food trucks to learn from?,train

The starting date is conventionally held to be 24 April 1915, the day that Ottoman authorities rounded up, arrested, and deported 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders from Constantinople to Ankara, the majority of whom were eventually murdered.The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly, and the infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre. Other indigenous and Christian ethnic groups such as the Assyrians and the Ottoman Greeks were similarly targeted for extermination by the Ottoman government in the Assyrian genocide and the Greek genocide, and their treatment is considered by some historians to be part of the same genocidal policy.

The concept of the British Empire is a construct and was never a legal entity, unlike the Roman or other European empires. There was no imperial constitution, no office of emperor, no uniformity of laws. So when it began, when it ended, and what stages it went through is a matter of opinion, not official orders or laws. The dividing line was Britain's shift in the 1763-93 period from emphasis on Western to Eastern territories following U.S. independence. The London bureaucracy governing the colonies also changed, policies to white settler colonies changed and slavery was phased out.The first major history was The Expansion of England (1883), by Sir John Seeley. It was a bestseller for decades, and was widely admired by the imperialistic faction in British politics, and opposed by the anti-imperialists of the Liberal Party.  The book points out how and why Britain gained the colonies, the character of the Empire, and the light in which it should be regarded. It was well written and persuasive.  Seeley argued that British rule is in India's best interest. He also warned that India had to be protected and vastly increased the responsibilities and dangers to Britain. The book contains the much-quoted statement that 'we seem, as it were, to have conquered half the world in a fit of absence of mind'. Expansion of England appeared at an opportune time, and did much to make the British regard the colonies as an expansion of the British state as well as of British nationality, and to confirm to them the value of Britain's empire in the East.  In his history of the British Empire, written in 1940, A. P. Newton lamented that Seeley 'dealt in the main with the great wars of the eighteenth century and this gave the false impression that the British Empire has been founded largely by war and conquest, an idea that was unfortunately planted firmly in the public mind, not only in Great Britain, but also in foreign countries'.",Why did the British continue the confessional millet system from the Ottoman Empire?,train

Slavery was a legal institution in all of the 13 American colonies and Canada (acquired by Britain in 1763). The profits of the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to 5% of the British economy at the time of the Industrial Revolution. The Somersett's case in 1772 was generally taken at the time to have decided that the condition of slavery did not exist under English law in England. In 1785, English poet William Cowper wrote: 'We have no slaves at home – Then why abroad? Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs receive our air, that moment they are free. They touch our country, and their shackles fall. That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud. And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then, And let it circulate through every vein.' In 1807, following many years of lobbying by the abolitionist movement, led primarily by William Wilberforce, the British Parliament voted to make the slave trade illegal anywhere in the Empire with the Slave Trade Act 1807. Thereafter Britain took a prominent role in combating the trade, and slavery itself was abolished in the British Empire with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. Between 1808 and 1860, the West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard. Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade.

He set up a controlled experiment using oranges, which the prey fed on, as the spatially structured habitat in which the predator and prey would interact. At first, Huffaker experienced difficulties similar to those of Gause in creating a stable predator–prey interaction. By using oranges only, the prey species quickly became extinct followed consequently with predator extinction. However, he discovered that by modifying the spatial structure of the habitat, he could manipulate the population dynamics and allow the overall survival rate for both species to increase. He did this by altering the distance between the prey and oranges (their food), establishing barriers to predator movement, and creating corridors for the prey to disperse. These changes resulted in increased habitat patches and in turn provided more areas for the prey to seek temporary protection. When the prey would become extinct locally at one habitat patch, they were able to reestablish by migrating to new patches before being attacked by predators. This habitat spatial structure of patches allowed for coexistence between the predator and prey species and promoted a stable population oscillation model. Although the term metapopulation had not yet been coined, the environmental factors of spatial heterogeneity and habitat patchiness would later describe the conditions of a metapopulation relating to how groups of spatially separated populations of species interact with one another. Huffaker's experiment is significant because it showed how metapopulations can directly affect the predator–prey interactions and in turn influence population dynamics.",Where is the Venus flytrap native to?,train

Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit.

Once they reach their prey, they touch it very softly with their antennae to assess its size and nutritional value. After each poke, the antenna is hastily retracted to avoid detection by the prey individual. This investigation may last anywhere upwards of ten seconds, until the velvet worm makes a decision as to whether to attack it, or until it disturbs the prey and the prey flees. Hungry Onychophora spend less time investigating their prey and are quicker to apply their slime. Once slime has been squirted, Onychophora are determined to pursue and devour their prey, in order to recoup the energetic investment. They have been observed to spend up to ten minutes searching for removed prey, after which they return to their slime to eat it. In the case of smaller prey, they may opt not to use slime at all. Subsequently, a soft part of the prey item (usually a joint membrane in arthropod prey) is identified, punctured with a bite from the jaws, and injected with saliva. This kills the prey very quickly and begins a slower process of digestion. While the onychophoran waits for the prey to digest, it salivates on its slime and begins to eat it (and anything attached to it). It subsequently tugs and slices at the earlier perforation to allow access to the now-liquefied interior of its prey.  The jaws operate by moving backwards and forwards along the axis of the body (not in a side-to-side clipping motion as in arthropods), conceivably using a pairing of musculature and hydrostatic pressure. The pharynx is specially adapted for sucking, to extract the liquefied tissue; the arrangement of the jaws about the tongue and lip papillae ensures a tight seal and the establishment of suction. In social groups, the dominant female is the first to feed, not permitting competitors access to the prey item for the first hour of feeding. Subsequently, subordinate individuals begin to feed.

Some introduced freshwater fish species have had devastating impacts on Australia's endemic freshwater fish species and other native aquatic life. For example, in much of south eastern Australia's freshwater systems introduced carp (often incorrectly called 'European' carp) dominate the lowland reaches, while introduced trout species almost completely dominate the upland reaches. While the damaging impact of carp is well recognised, little in the way of control measures have been employed to control their spread.

However, the difficulties of integrating and valuing the assets of four companies, as well as legal issues, delayed the initiative.

This so well cited definition is not completely exact as the last four words show. What are the kinanthropometric methods that truly tell us something about principal functions of the body? In principle an amount or distribution of fat mass or muscular mass could be correlated or show a level of causation with any disease. The morpho-physiological mechanisms involved in those explanations are big enigmas today. Few diseases are in practice diagnosed using anthropometric measures and body composition methods at any public health care system. The use of body composition outcomes for predicting health status due to their associations with a lot of physiological variables is valid. However, this purpose is not included within the kinanthropometric perspective because the absent of movement prediction's probability in those diagnoses. The countless uses of some of its fundamental methods have to be accepted but they should not change the theoretical core of the scientific discipline. On the other hand, this definition omits some important objectives of quantifying the body that are an indelible part of its frame; for example: the study of human shape using the  method of the anthropometric somatotype of Carter and Heath (1990). Besides that, the performance of movement is why one studies the body size, proportionality, body composition, and human shape.

Interventional tables with floating table tops and tilt and cradle compete with fully integrated flexible OR tables. Identification of the right table is a compromise between interventional and surgical requirements. Surgical and interventional requirements may be mutually exclusive. Surgeons, especially orthopedic, general and neurosurgeons usually expect a table with a segmented tabletop for flexible patient positioning. For imaging purposes, a radiolucent tabletop, allowing full body coverage, is required. Therefore, non-breakable carbon fibre tabletops are used. Interventionalists require a floating tabletop to allow fast and precise movements during angiography. Cardiac and vascular surgeons, in general, have less complex positioning needs, but based on their interventional experience in angiography may be used to having fully motorized movements of the table and the tabletop. For positioning patients on non breakable tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. inflatable cushions. Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable angiography tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended. To further accommodate typical surgical needs, side rails for mounting surgical equipment like retractors or limb holders should be available for the table. The position of the table in the room also impacts surgical workflow. A diagonal position in the OR may be considered in order to gain space and flexibility in the room, as well as access to the patient from all sides. Alternatively, a conventional surgery table can be combined with an imaging system if the vendor offers a corresponding integration. The operating room can then be used either with a radiotranslucent but not breakable tabletop that supports 3D imaging, or with a universal breakable tabletop that provides enhanced patient positioning, but restricts 3D imaging. The latter are particularly suited for neuro- or orthopedic surgery, and these integrated solutions recently also became commercially available. If it is planned to share the room for hybrid and open conventional procedures, these are sometimes preferred. They provide greater workflow flexibility because the tabletops are dockable and can be easily exchanged, but require some compromises with interventional imaging. In summary, important aspects to be included considered are the position in the room, radiolucency (carbon fiber tabletop), compatibility, and integration of imaging devices with the operating table. Further aspects include table load, adjustable table height, and horizontal mobility (floating) including vertical and lateral tilt. It is important to also have proper accessories available, such as rails for mounting special surgical equipment retractors, camera holder). Free floating angiography tables with tilt and cradle capabilities are best suited for cardiovascular hybrid operating rooms.",When should you consider shoulder surgery?,train

In some cases with juveniles, bracing has reduced curves significantly, going from a 40 degrees (of the curve, mentioned in length above.) out of the brace to 18 degrees in it. Braces are sometimes prescribed for adults to relieve pain related to scoliosis. Bracing involves fitting the patient with a device that covers the torso; in some cases, it extends to the neck.

The effectiveness of the brace depends not only on brace design and orthotist skill but on patient compliance and amount of wear per day.The typical use of braces is for idiopathic curves that are not grave enough to warrant surgery, but they may also be used to prevent the progression of more severe curves in young children, to buy the child time to grow before performing surgery, which would prevent further growth in the part of the spine affected.",When should you consider shoulder surgery?,train

After MacShara attended four months of training courses at the regional Burger King training facilities in Michigan and in the Florida headquarters on how to operate and administer a Burger King franchise, it was agreed that the partners would take over operation of an existing Burger King location in Drayton Plains, Michigan. However, during this time disagreements arose between the partners and BK over issues of rent, construction fees, building designs and the assignment of legal liabilities. MacShara and Ruzewicz finally signed their franchise agreement after gaining limited concessions over the issues, with Rudzewicz assuming a 20-year, $1,000,000 financial obligation over the life of the contract.","No, not information about Burger King's acquisition.

Franchisees sued the parent company claiming that it did not have the authority to dictate pricing structures for the independently held franchises. The court dismissed the case in a decision that stated the company could legally dictate pricing structures over its franchises objections, but found that there was enough evidence to allow the franchises to move forward with their claims of dealing in bad faith in a separate case.

New owners were barred from living more than an hour's drive from their restaurants, corporations were not permitted to own franchises, and franchisees could no longer operate other chains. This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King as Chart House had. It also became a requirement for the corporation to own the properties of any new store and lease them to franchisees. This policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies. Beyond the changes to the franchise system, Smith also restructured Burger King's corporate operations to better compete against his former employer as well as then up and coming chain Wendy's. He broadened the product offering by adding the Burger King specialty sandwich line in 1979, and also added many non-hamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings. The new line was one of the first attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic, in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years, members of which were presumably willing spend more on a higher quality product.

McDonald's was among the very first of the burger chains to take the global establishment of its brand seriously, but it was not the only one.

An example of a protein that displays different function in different oligomeric states is pyruvate kinase which exhibits metabolic activity as a tetramer and thyroid hormone–binding activity as a monomer. Changes in the concentrations of ligands or substrates may cause a switch in protein a protein's function.  For example, in the presence of low iron concentrations, aconitase functions as an enzyme while at high iron concentration, aconitase functions as an iron-responsive element-binding protein (IREBP). Proteins may also perform separate functions through the use of alternative binding sites that perform different tasks. An example of this is ceruloplasmin, a protein that functions as an oxidase in copper metabolism and moonlights as a copper-independent glutathione peroxidase. Lastly, phosphorylation may sometimes cause a switch in the function of a moonlighting protein. For example, phosphorylation of phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) at Ser-185 by protein kinase CK2 causes it to stop functioning as an enzyme, while retaining its function as an autocrine motility factor.

Once they suspect a chemical may be toxic, it is studied to determine the human reference dose, which is determined to be the lowest observable adverse effect level. During these studies, a high dose is tested to see if it causes any adverse health effects, and if it does not, lower doses are considered to be safe as well. This does not take into account the fact that with some chemicals found in plastics, such as BPA, lower doses can have a discernible effect.Even with this often complicated evaluation process, policies have been put into place in order to help alleviate plastic pollution and its effects. Government regulations have been implemented that ban some chemicals from being used in specific plastic products. In Canada, the United States, and the European Union, BPA has been banned from being incorporated in the production of baby bottles and children’s cups, due to health concerns and the higher vulnerability of younger children to the effects of BPA. Taxes have been established in order to discourage specific ways of managing plastic waste. The landfill tax, for example, creates an incentive to choose to recycle plastics rather than contain them in landfills, by making the latter more expensive. There has also been a standardization of the types of plastics that can be considered compostable. The European Norm EN 13432, which was set by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), lists the standards that plastics must meet, in terms of compostability and biodegradability, in order to officially be labeled as compostable.",Tell me more about biodegradable plastics.,train

Plastics pose a particular challenge in recycling because they are derived from polymers and monomers that often cannot be separated and returned to their virgin states, for this reason not all plastics can be recycled for re-use, in fact some estimates claim only 20% to 30% of plastics can be recycled at all. Fibre-reinforced plastics and their matrices share these disposal and environmental concerns. In addition to these concerns, the fact that the fibres themselves are difficult to remove from the matrix and preserve for re-use means FRP's amplify these challenges. FRP's are inherently difficult to separate into base materials, that is into fibre and matrix, and the matrix into separate usable plastics, polymers, and monomers. These are all concerns for environmentally informed design today. Plastics do often offer savings in energy and economic savings in comparison to other materials.

Recovering germ as intact as possible is necessary to prevent any oil contamination in the final products. Attrition mills like Disk mill is used to coarse grind the softened corn kernels. The grinding is slow and the elements used to grind are blunt to ensure intact removal of germ. Water is added to the ground material to make a thick slurry of macerated kernels and whole germ. 40-50% of crude oil in germ makes it less dense than other particles and as a result germ floats in the mixture. The mixture is then passed through germ hydrocyclones with an over and underflow. Overflow will be composed majorly of germ and water and underflow will have fiber, starch, protein and water. The overflow is passed through the hydroclone multiple times since 100% separation cannot be achieved in single pass. The separated germ is cleaned, dried and passed through germ press to extract oil from it. Solvent extraction can also be used alternatively. The solid particles remaining after oil extraction is called germ meal which is further dried.Use of germ meal: It is a good source of amino acids and is carrier of micro-ingredients in animal food formulations.

There were three categories of securities companies in Japan, the first consisting of the 'Big Four' securities houses (among the six largest such firms in the world): Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko, and Yamaichi. The Big Four played a key role in international financial transactions and were members of the New York Stock Exchange. Nomura was the world's largest single securities firm; its net capital, in excess of US$10 billion in 1986, exceeded that of Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers, and Shearson Lehman combined. In 1986, Nomura became the first Japanese member of the London Stock Exchange. Nomura and Daiwa were primary dealers in the United States Treasury bond market. The second tier of securities firms contained ten medium-sized firms. The third tier consisted of all the smaller securities firms registered in Japan. Many of these smaller firms were affiliates of the Big Four, while some were affiliated with banks. In 1986 eighty-three of the smaller firms were members of the Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange. Japan's securities firms derived most of their income from brokerage fees, equity and bond trading, underwriting, and dealing. Other services included the administration of trusts.

In a water tube boiler, the water is recirculated inside until the vapor pressure of the water overcomes the vapor pressure inside the stream drum and becomes saturated steam. The forced circulation boiler begins the same as a natural circulation boiler, at the feed water pump. Water is introduced into the steam drum and is circulated around the boiler, leaving only as steam.  What makes the forced circulation boiler different is its use of a secondary pump that circulates water through the boiler. The secondary pump takes the feed water going to the boiler and raises the pressure of the water going in.  In a natural circulation boilers, the circulation of water is dependent on the differential pressures caused by the change of density in the water as it is heated. That is to say that as the water is heated and starts turning to steam, the density decreases sending the hottest water and steam to the top of the furnace tubes. In contrast to the natural circulation boiler, the forced circulation boiler uses a water circulation pump to force that flow instead of waiting for the differential to form. Because of this, the generation tubes of a forced circulation boiler are able to be oriented in whatever way is required by space constraints. Water is taken from the drum and forced through the steel tubes. In this way it is able to produce steam much faster than that of a natural circulation boiler",Oh that much water?

That is why Baytex is not technically violating any laws by open venting its bitumen processing tanks.  Because emissions from these tanks are known to cause health effects and affect air quality other companies like Penn West Petroleum use fully closed vapour recovery systems.  Baytex has chosen not to expend the money installing these systems on the 86 super-heated oil sands processing tanks in the area despite reporting a record 200% rate of return on investment.  A return rate that Baytex claims is one of the highest for any oil project in North America. The Alberta Government has expressed serious concerns about what Baytex is doing and has taken the unprecedented step of not only not allowing Baytex any new well licences in the area and but has also convened a public inquiry.

This practice makes difficult to identify easily and clearly which part of production is due to losses or waste generation.

These studies show that there is not yet a consistent methodology for measuring energy consumption in local versus non-local farms. “Local” is not a clearly defined measurement, and by only examining the energy in terms of “food miles” versus an entire life cycle assessment (LCA), much of the research on local farming is missing key components of the farm-to-consumer process, and the energy consumption involved. For example, despite the amount of greenhouse gases emitted from transporting farm foods to consumers, agricultural soils are also responsible for releasing significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (Schlesinger).The life cycle assessment attempts to measure the impacts of each activity directly or indirectly involved in the production, transport, storage, retail, consumption and disposal of a particular food from “farm to fork” or “farm to waste”. Studies that examine the LCA still show that there is no clear conclusion on the environmental impact of local versus non-local agriculture. A study in Sweden that examined bread production using local flour versus flour from other regions in Sweden found that the smaller scale of local farms results in less energy efficiency5.  Another study supports this argument that global food systems have better energy efficiency due to the size of production, the so-called “ecology-of-scale”. Both of these studies are countered by other studies that found lower emissions on small scale bread making facilities, contesting the accuracy of the measurements in the Schilich and Fleissner study.

If one were to hold his or her breath (or breathe very slowly, as in the case of respiratory depression), the blood would continue delivering carbon dioxide to the alveoli in the lungs, and the amount of carbon dioxide in the lungs would increase. On the other hand, if one were to hyperventilate, then fresh air would be drawn into the lungs and carbon dioxide would rapidly be blown out. In the first case, because carbon dioxide is accumulating in the lungs, alveolar P would become very high. In the second case, because carbon dioxide is rapidly exiting the lungs, alveolar P would be very low. Note that these two situations, those of respiratory depression and hyperventilation, produce effects that are immediately analogous to the experiment described previously, in which the partial pressures of carbon dioxide were varied and the resulting changes in pH observed. As indicated by the Davenport Diagram, respiratory depression, which results in a high P, will lower blood pH. Hyperventilation will have the opposite effects. A decrease in blood pH due to respiratory depression is called respiratory acidosis. An increase in blood pH due to hyperventilation is called respiratory alkalosis (Fig. 11).",What is high blood carbon dioxide?,train

In 1961, this changed rapidly with the election of his collector Lyndon B. Johnson (1908–1973) to the Vice-Presidency of the United States. With his ascension from the United States Senate to being Vice President, Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson (1912–2007) purchased a large French-style chateau from the socialite and heiress Perle Mesta (1889–1975). They decorated the house with French antiques and tapestries that were already in the home, but the foyer was hung with Texas wildflower paintings by Salinas. Lady Bird Johnson was quoted as saying of them that 'I want to see them when I open the door, to remind me of where I come from.' After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson became President and his Salinas paintings were brought with him into the White House. He told the Washington press that Porfirio Salinas was 'his favorite artist.' President Johnson also presented a Salinas painting to President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz of Mexico as an official gift from the United States. The patronage of the President was a tremendous boost to the artist's career and during the 1960s, his work sold briskly for ever higher prices. The Johnsons' Salinas paintings remain in the collection of the LBJ Ranch today and President and Lady Bird Johnson were both advocates and admirers of wildflowers. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson will always remain linked to the subject of wildflowers because of her Beautify America campaign and the Highway Beautification Act which was passed by the United States Congress in 1965.

This quote from American anthropologist Wilhelm Solheim illustrates the matter:The finds at Ayub Cave in South Cotabato again verified the great pottery tradition of the Philippines. In terms of quantity and quality, these artifacts have no match in Southeast Asia for such an early time period. One interesting question is whether or not the Philippines ever developed an export industry for pottery. Generally it is known that the Thais had developed quite a flourishing industry, which is sometimes considered unique in SE Asia. However, it is well documented that the Philippines was in fact a major destination of pottery buyers from the islands of Japan at least. Japanese texts mention trading expeditions to the island of Rusun (Luzon) going well back before the Spanish period. What they sought were the highly prized Rusun and Namban jars. In fact, these jars were far more precious than gold to the Japanese because of their ability to act as tea canisters. Japanese texts were very specific about these jars being made in Luzon. The Tokiko, for example, calls the Rusun and Namban jars, Ru-sun tsukuru or Lu-sung ch'i (Chinese), which means simply 'made in Luzon.' In the Tokiko it mentions that all Rusun jars had this marking known as the rokuru (wheel mark). Those familiar with Philippine ethnography will know that this spiral is commonly used by many of the Philippine tribes. The following symbols were used to identify which kiln was used to make the jar: identified 'Imbe' jars, meant jars coming from Bizen kiln, and mark three times meant a canister from the same oven. A jar with this mark is said to be made of Namban clay. This marking corresponds to the syllable la in Pampanga; Tagbanua for ka ('Chinese Pottery,' Field Museum of Natural History-Anth., vol.xii, Jul.1912) Of course, the symbol for la can also be the same as that for lu, and so this might correspond to the symbol said to stand for Lu in Rusun-no kokuji (Luzon national writing). According to the Tokiko, certain types of Rusun jars were distinguished by this character. De Morga mentions that Japanese traders were still coming in large numbers for these jars during his time, and that they were willing to spend great sums for them. Apparently work on these jars continued in the North, possibly among the unconquered Igorots, for De Morga had no knowledge of such current production. Later, the knowledge may have again trickled down to Vigan, where a flourishing industry of Burnay jar manufacture survives to this day. Although the Japanese described very high quality jars coming from the Philippines, not all were of elegant nature. In fact, De Morga had some disdain for some of the jars that the Japanese were buying, so they could have been similar to the well-known balanga and other jars in use today. These jars are generally handed down as heirlooms and are noted for their qualities in enhancing the fermentation process. Possibly one of the Japanese uses for the Rusun jars was fermentation of products like Kombucha and Umeboshi plums. Indeed, a Japanese acquaintance stated that their family in rural Japan used old Rusun jars for exactly this purpose up to this day. The Filipinos were skilled in all types of fishing and fisheries. In the south, the basnig, a Viking-like ship, was and is the vessel of choice among the Bisayans for ocean fishing. The salambao is a type of raft that utilizes a large fishing net which is lowered into the water via a type of lever made of two criss-crossed poles. Night fishing was accomplished with the help of candles similar to the copal of Mexico. These candles were made from a particular type of resin. Fish corrals, like the ones still used today, were also employed by the ancient Filipino. However, the area in which the Filipino most astonished Westerners was in their advanced aquaculture:",Does the public pay Jared Kushner?,train

Both of these performances of the song featured different lyrics than the version that would ultimately wind up on Vs. 'Daughter' is played at nearly every Pearl Jam show, almost always with an extension of the ending that could be an improvisation or a segment of another song. This extension is called a 'Daughter tag'. A different form of extension to the song was first introduced in the band's performance on Saturday Night Live in April 1994, just eight days after the death of Nirvana frontman and grunge pioneer Kurt Cobain. A tribute to Cobain, it is called 'Daughter/Hey Hey, My My' by fans, since the extension is from the Neil Young song 'Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)', which Cobain's suicide note had quoted. Another popular tag of the song is the 'It's Okay' tag, which includes a slow improvisation based on 'It's Okay' by garage rock band Dead Moon.Live performances of 'Daughter' can be found on the 'Dissident'/Live in Atlanta box set, the live album Live on Two Legs, various official bootlegs, the live album Live at Benaroya Hall, the live album Live in NYC 12/31/92, the Live at the Gorge 05/06 box set, and the live album Live at Lollapalooza 2007.

By 2003, Welch believed that he had been snubbed by the Hall as the directors in New York, music industry insiders, did not like his style of music. However, he did believe that the lawsuit was a factor in his being blackballed, as it prevented him from getting in touch with Mick Fleetwood, whom he was not talking to at the time of the induction, who may have otherwise have used his influence to get Welch included with other members of the band. For example, Jerry Garcia had used his influence to get 12 members of the Grateful Dead inducted into the Hall, including some members whose contributions were considered marginal. As the Plain Dealer article noted, 16 members of the Parliament-Funkadelic collective were inducted into the Rock Hall—an oddly large number in the author's view, considering Welch's pivotal role in Fleetwood Mac and a board member's contention that only band members who made important creative contributions to a group's sound and impact are nominated for inclusion.",Why were the Grateful Dead such an influential live band?,train

One of the simplest ways to do this is asking open-ended questions. Open-ended questions such as 'Tell me about a time when….' or 'How might this information be useful to you?' cause learners to think about how new information may relate to their own experience.  Student responses to such questions are opportunities for experiencing the perspectives of others.  For these questions to be effective it is critical that instructors focus on teaching content that is useful for participants.  The importance of using these types of strategies with adults contributes to what  Bain(2004 p. 4) noted as critical learning environments where instructors 'embed' the skills they are teaching in 'authentic tasks that will arouse curiosity, challenge students to rethink assumptions and examine their mental modes of reality'. Mezirow J. (1997) who asserts that learners need to practice in recognizing frames of reference and using their imaginations to redefine problems from different perspectives. (pg. 10) I made the connection by also adding the point that 'to promote discovery learning, the educator often reframes learner questions in terms of the learner’s current level of understanding. Learning contracts, group projects, role play, case studies, and simulations are classroom methods associated with transformative education.' Such approaches emphasize that learning is not an 'all or nothing' process but that students learn the new information that is presented to them by building upon knowledge that they already possess.  It is therefore important that teachers constantly assess the knowledge their students have gained to make sure that the students' perceptions of the new knowledge are what the teacher had intended.  Teachers will find that since the students build upon already existing knowledge, when they are called upon to retrieve the new information, they may make errors.  It is known as reconstruction error when we fill in the gaps of our understanding with logical, though incorrect, thoughts.  Teachers need to catch and try to correct these errors, though it is inevitable that some reconstruction error will continue to occur because of our innate retrieval limitations.",What is TREC for information retrieval research?,validation

Transfer-appropriate processing (TAP) argues that to have memory successfully recalled there needs to be a successful encoding process.  There has been an argument among cognitive psychologists that suggests that the encoding process and retrieval processes are substantially similar.  In an experiment that tested TAP researchers found this argument to ring true. They found that successful memory retrieval backs up the encoding process, which therefore has a similar effect on both the retrieval and encoding function.  This experiment also pointed out that there are certain variables to consider when looking at TAP because they greatly limit the effectiveness of the retrieval and encoding processes. They believed that to change TAP into a broader form, you would have to question whether the two processing forms actually coincide.  Also, TAP is an information-processing action that occurs in two stages; the first includes the procedures that should manipulate the information that coincides with the task activity, and the second stage focuses on the experience that the task activity created. Meaning, that we do not process stimuli all at one time, but instead break it down into a series of responses.",What are some recent TREC tasks?,train

Roughly, it is the view that there are independent moral standards: some actions are right or wrong in themselves, independent of God's commands. This is the view accepted by Socrates and Euthyphro in Plato's dialogue. The Mu'tazilah school of Islamic theology also defended the view (with, for example, Nazzam maintaining that God is powerless to engage in injustice or lying), as did the Islamic philosopher Averroes. Thomas Aquinas never explicitly addresses the Euthyphro dilemma, but Aquinas scholars often put him on this side of the issue. Aquinas draws a distinction between what is good or evil in itself and what is good or evil because of God's commands, with unchangeable moral standards forming the bulk of natural law. Thus he contends that not even God can change the Ten Commandments (adding, however, that God can change what individuals deserve in particular cases, in what might look like special dispensations to murder or steal). Among later Scholastics, Gabriel Vásquez is particularly clear-cut about obligations existing prior to anyone's will, even God's. Modern natural law theory saw Grotius and Leibniz also putting morality prior to God's will, comparing moral truths to unchangeable mathematical truths, and engaging voluntarists like Pufendorf in philosophical controversy. Cambridge Platonists like Benjamin Whichcote and Ralph Cudworth mounted seminal attacks on voluntarist theories, paving the way for the later rationalist metaethics of Samuel Clarke and Richard Price; what emerged was a view on which eternal moral standards, though dependent on God in some way, exist independently of God's will and prior to God's commands. Contemporary philosophers of religion who embrace this horn of the Euthyphro dilemma include Richard Swinburne and T. J. Mawson (though see below for complications).",e-Discovery?

Often, users are uncertain about their exact medical situations, are unfamiliar with medical terminology, and hence have difficulty in coming up with the right search keywords. An intelligent medical search engine is specifically designed to address this challenge. It uses several techniques to improve its usability and search result quality. First, it uses an interactive questionnaire-based query interface to guide users to provide the most important information about their situations. Users perform search by selecting symptoms and answering questions rather than by typing keyword queries. Second, it uses medical knowledge (e.g., diagnostic decision trees) to automatically form multiple queries from a user' answers to the questions. These queries are used to perform search simultaneously. Third, it provides various kinds of help functions. For instance, if a user has made incorrect selections, does not know which symptoms to select, or cannot answer a question, he or she can invoke the search engine's help functionality and describe his or her health situation there.

Water users will eventually adapt to more frequent and severe droughts, in part by shifting limited water supplies towards higher-value uses.  Such shifts could be from low- to high-value crops, or from agricultural and industrial to environmental and municipal uses.  A period of delay is likely, however, because gradual changes in the frequency and severity of drought will be difficult to distinguish from normal inter-annual variations in precipitation.  Economic losses will be larger during this period of delay, as compared to a world with instantaneous adjustment, but preemptive adaptation could also be costly given the uncertainty surrounding future climate.

Effects of global warming include rising sea levels, regional changes in precipitation, more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, and expansion of deserts.  Surface temperature increases are greatest in the Arctic, with the continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice.  Overall, higher temperatures bring more rain and snowfall, but for some regions droughts and wildfires increase instead.

Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.  These effects are most severe for the world’s poorest countries.   A changing climate also results in economic burdens.  The economies in Least Developed Countries have lost an average of 7% of their gross domestic product for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced labor productivity.

This agreement is similar to the Kyoto Protocol, except that each country’s acceptance and participation is not mandatory.  Also, each country will commit to report their changes.  The agreement is on a goodwill basis and assumes that each country will live up to their part in saving the climate by reducing greenhouse gases.  180 Countries Pledged their Support On December 18, 2009, it was signed into agreement with more than 180 countries pledging their support.  If all of the countries who have signed the contract to date were to live up to their end of the bargain, the greenhouse gas levels would be significantly reduced.  Consequently, a reduction in greenhouse gases, which are responsible for the greenhouse effect would slow down global warming which contributes to several catastrophic disasters including heat waves, droughts, hurricanes, and desertification among many others.  A Different Approach Since this contract is not legally binding, it is expected that  many countries who were not part of the Kyoto Protocol will sign the agreement as they are now without worry of legal ramifications if they do not reach their targets.",How did other parties to the Paris Agreement feel about Trump’s intention of withdrawing the US from it?,train

5484,133_3-2,0,MARCO_44_2001302180-2,0,Diagnosing Parkinson's disease Managing Parkinson's disease with medications Managing Parkinson's disease with surgery Next lesson Multiple sclerosis Video transcript so in most people right when we're talking about their Parkinson's disease we say that their Parkinson's disease is idiopathic and that just means that we don't know what caused it and that's actually the case for the vast majority of people with Parkinson's disease about eighty-five percent of people so it's a lot right but in a handful of people with Parkinson's disease about 15% we actually do know what caused the disease and for these people something's actually gone wrong with at least one of their genes so a quick recap on genes remember that genes are essentially specific segments of our DNA right so you'd find them in almost every cell in your body so there are specific segments of DNA that provide instructions to the cell and each gene is like a special recipe so each gene has instructions for how to make different proteins and once these proteins are made they go off and they do tons of different tasks tons of different important tasks all around our bodies like well basically everything basically everything is done by proteins from creating our cellular structure to our organs to our enzymes those are proteins to essentially every structure or process in our bodies that you can even think of absolutely everything somehow involves proteins so when something goes wrong with our genes let's say it's supposed to look like this right but maybe due to a mutation a change in that gene it ends up actually looking kind of different so maybe something like this here now all of a sudden the instructions the recipe that that gene has for making their proteins they're not correct anymore right they're not the same and so the proteins that should be made the proteins that we want these genes to make now they can't be made properly anymore at least in cells that have these genes that are affected that are changed that are mutated and when proteins are made properly well they won't be able to carry out their normal roles anymore right so we actually have a collection of genes a family of genes that when they're changed when they're mutated in some 'we can either directly cause or increase our chance of developing Parkinson's disease and this depends on on which gene gets mutated now remember how we get our DNA how we get our chromosomes so we have 23 single chromosomes that we get from our dad and we get another 23 single chromosomes from our mom and they form pairs so we end up with 23 pairs of chromosomes right so that means that we have two copies of each gene right one copy came from your mom and one copy came from your dad now let's actually classify genetic causes of Parkinson's disease into two groups so two types of inheritance if you will so we'll say autosomal dominant over here and and we'll say autosomal recessive over here on this side and this will all start to make sense in a minute here and the inheritance patterns can get really detailed and messy so I'm not going to really go into all of that at the moment but basically I want to get across here that the autosomal dominant types of Parkinson's disease or really any other disease that's inherited in an autosomal dominant way you only really need one bad copy of the gene so either one bad copy from your mom or one bad copy from your dad and that would be enough to cause the disease so in this case in our case that's Parkinson's disease and autosomal recessive well that means that both mom and dad need to pass on to you a mutated copy of the gene and there's one other thing I should mention so so when we say that a gene mutation causes a disease so in this case we say a gene mutation causes Parkinson's disease we can either mean that it definitely causes the disease 100% so if you get the mutated copy or if it needs two copies of the gene you will definitely develop the disease or we can mean that getting the mutated copy or copies will increase your chance of developing the disease so those two things are a little different right and for some genes certain mutations within that gene will definitely cause the disease and other mutations in that gene may just increase the chance of a disease developing and that's because different mutations in Jeane affect the genes protein in different ways right so some mutations may be more detrimental than others so that can increase the chance of disease developing so as we're chatting about these these mutated genes that we're going to get to that are relevant to Parkinson's disease we're just going to say that they can cause the disease but in the back of our minds we just have to remember that depending on which specific mutation in the gene is happening because there can be quite a few different ones in one gene and this is still being researched right the mutation can either 100% cause the disease or just increase the chances of developing the disease okay so there are five main genes that we know about so there are a few more but there's five main ones that when they're mutated in some way can cause Parkinson's disease so we won't go into all of these genes but let's go over a few of the genes that are a bit more commonly mutated so let's head over here to our first chromosome chromosome number one so here's our first chromosome so it's just it's just hanging out here and and right about here we have a gene called Park seven and park seven it has instructions for making a protein called DJ one so here's DJ one here and and DJ one kind of makes me think of a mom when I think about what DJ one does I think if I think of a mom it does things like protecting and guiding right protecting and guiding our molecules around our body you know like how your mom protects and guides you right so it helps protect ourselves it helps protect them during situations that stress ourselves out and and it helps guide our proteins so it helps guide them to do things like make sure they're folding in the correct three-dimensional shape because remember that our proteins are proteins need to get into a certain shape in order to be able to function properly right and dj1 also helps to make sure that damaged proteins proteins that we we don't want anymore are sent off to be broken down because otherwise they kind of pile up in our cells and they get in the way right now this last ones not very mom-like I'm sure none of our moms would send us off to be degraded but anyway so those are some of the main tasks of dj1 so some mutations in the gene park7 can cause Parkinson's disease park7 is one of those genes where you need to get a mutated copy from both your mom and your dad in order to develop Parkinson's disease so this would be considered an autosomal recessive cause of Parkinson's disease and it's actually responsible for early onset Parkinson's disease so so Parkinson's that's diagnosed before the age of 50 years old so when park7 is mutated when the genes DNA is changed in some way that changes the instructions on how to make the dj1 protein right because the gene carries our recipe for that protein so when this has changed dj1 isn't made properly and therefore it can't function properly it can't do all of these important mom-like tasks that we talked about so that's park7 and dj1 so what's our next gene let's let's jump over here to chromosome 6 and let's check out our next gene so about about here on chromosome 6 about here this is this is where our Park 2 gene is and for a mutation in this gene to cause Parkinson's disease it would need to be inherited in an autosomal recessive way as well a mutated copy from both your mom and your dad oh and something that's really interesting is that the park 2 gene it's one of the largest genes that we humans have in our whole body so it's one of the biggest genes that we have so park2 it encodes for a protein called Parkin so let's draw let's draw a little Park in protein here and Parkin has this really really important role what it does is it tags other proteins that are damaged or or that we have too many of there they're in excess and it tags them with this molecule called ubiquitin so ubiquitin is like a it's like a little flag it's a flag that alerts ourselves to shuttle these proteins that we don't want that we don't want anymore and it alerts them to shuttle them to these structures in our cells called proteasome and this is where those proteins that we don't want get broken down and disposed of so proteasomes are kind of like the the waste disposal facility in our cells so parking is really really important from making sure that we don't have all these excess or damaged proteins kind of piling up in ourselves and getting in the way so we actually know of a couple 100 different Park two mutations that can cause parkinson's disease so some of these mutations are associated with the juvenile form of Parkinson's disease which is essentially an extremely early onset type of Parkinson's disease relatively speaking to when it normally comes on so when people are diagnosed before the age of 20 and some other park2 mutations they're associated with late onset Parkinson's disease which is when people are diagnosed after the age of 50 years old but in either case whether it's early or late Parkinson's disease these mutations have changed the gene a bit right they've changed our instructions for making Parkin and so we end up with a non-functional Parkin protein a Parkin protein that just can't do what it needs to do it can't function properly it can't tag these damaged proteins so that we get rid of them so our last gene that we're going to look at is is over here on chromosome 12 so here's chromosome 12 here I'll just draw it out and the gene that we're interested in is the LR rk2 gene so I'm going to call it lark - it's just a little easier to say and and it sits about here so so lark - gives us the recipe to make the protein dard erin and dart erin helps us do things like turn our cells on and off so that we can control their activity and and send signals around the brain so that different cells can talk to each other and what's really interesting is lark - mutations are actually the most common gene mutation that is associated with Parkinson's disease so this is the gene that we normally see issues with in people that have a genetic form of the disease and with this particular gene people only need to get one mutated copy from either of their parents rather than both so this is an autosomal dominant genetic cause of Parkinson's disease and just like before when when our lark - gene gets mutated we end up with a malformed a damaged dard erin protein being formed right so it's being produced by transcription and translation but because we've damaged the lark - gene in some way the instructions are all wrong so the protein ends up being formed a little differently so it can't function properly in order to carry out its really important roles so we've gone through some of these gene mutations that can as Parkinson's disease but by now you must be wondering yeah I get that I get that Park seven and park two and lark two can get mutated and produce malformed proteins and then they can't do their jobs correctly etc etc but what does that have to do with Parkinson's disease how does that cause Parkinson's disease and that's an excellent question and and the answer as it stands right now is that we actually don't know we don't know how these genes getting mutated and these proteins being malformed we don't know how that actually leads to the disease we just know that we consistently see Parkinson's disease development in people with these gene mutations but we don't yet know kind of step by step how people with these mutations actually develop Parkinson's disease so for now we'll just have to stay tuned into the ongoing research efforts to find out more about this one Putting it all together - Pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease

Step Four: Combine the Oil Mixture and Water Mixture Together I know, oil and water don’t mix—except when they do, thanks to a blender!  Scoop the oil mixture into the basin of a blender.  Make sure to really scrape out as much of the mixture as you can.  Place the lid on the blender and then turn it on medium-high.  Slowly stream in the water mixture a little at a time as the blender runs.  The mixture will continue to thicken with the more water you add (I know, it’s counterintuitive).  Once all the water is added, the mixture should be thick enough that the blender struggles to blend it.  That’s when you know it’s ready.  Turn off the blender and voila, you have lotion!  Depending on the power of your blender, the mixture may have heated up during the emulsion process—which is no big deal, it just means that the mixture will thicken even more as it cools back down to room temperature.

Adding pure essential oils to the pool of melted wax in a burning candle is safe, and a good way to create a stronger smell.  The essential oils will mix in with the wax and burn at the correct temperature, which will release a strong smell throughout the room.  But be careful, essential oils are flammable.

Some ingredients to look for include carrier oils and essential oils.  Carrier oils, which come from seeds and nuts, moisturize the skin among other attributes.  Carrier oils include coconut oil, jojoba oil, and almond oil.  Essential oils, such as sandalwood, pine, and cedarwood, typically provide a lotion with its scent (usually subtle) while offering other benefits for skin health.  Shea butter and cocoa butter have moisturizing qualities and help to soften skin.  Fatty alcohols, meanwhile, stabilize a lotion’s ingredients while also acting as an emollient, i.e., skin softener.  Some ingredients to avoid include synthetic colors and fragrances.  They often contain ingredients that can cause skin irritation, particularly for men with sensitive skin.  Short-chain alcohols –sometimes referred to as “simple” alcohol – can irritate and even damage the skin.  Be wary of chemical names such as isopropyl, ethanol, and propanol, among many others.

In addition, knowing the signs of heat injury and being able to treat it immediately will reduce the number of severe cases.  Cause When we exercise, our bodies cool off by sweating.  As we perspire, we lose necessary body fluids.  If we do not replace these fluids, we become dehydrated.  This makes it difficult to sweat and cool down, which can result in a heat injury.  During regular exercise, 70 to 90 percent of the energy our bodies produce is released by heat.  Many factors can hinder heat release and perspiration.  These include: Environment.",Cool.

Bend both knees until the left thigh is parallel to the ground and the right knee is hovering just above the ground, legs forming 90-degree angles.  Push through the left heel to return to standing.  When you’re ready, add resistance by holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.  If you’re working out at home, you use a towel as shown to make the move more challenging.

When you are beginning a workout plan with the goal to lose weight most professionals recommend a slightly different plan than the one previously discussed.  In order to lose weight, your caloric output must be greater than your caloric intake.  Dieting is one way to reduce caloric intake; however, dieting and nutrition alone will not produce the effect of both weight loss and toned muscles.  When you diet alone you lose weight from both fat and muscle.  Reducing muscle size decreases metabolism which makes it harder to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight over the long term.  Therefore, you must always incorporate exercise into any weight loss plan.  When you wish to lose weight most doctors recommend at least 30 minutes a day of some form of cardio exercise five times per week or more.  This can be combined with a weight training regimen similar to the two times per week per muscle group routine discussed above.

Refueling during your long runs helps to replace essential glucose that is burned as fuel.  Many experts advise refueling with some form of carbohydrate during high endurance runs lasting longer than 60 minutes.  2 ﻿ How Much to Eat How much you should eat when running is also determined by a few different factors.

This is the rate at which your body burns calories while at rest.  When you do cardio, your body does burn calories quickly during the exercise, but this rate drops once you are done.  On the other hand, strength training keeps your metabolic rate high long after you have left the gym.  Some secrets to weight lifting while trying to get lean include (7): 1.  Do more compound exercises.  They work out more muscle groups in a single move, thus burning more calories and building stronger muscles.  Great examples of such exercises include barbell deadlifts, squats, dumbbell bench press, dumbbell walking lunges, kettlebell squats press, and pullups.  2  .  Keep your heart rate up.  This is better achieved when you take short breaks during your workouts.  Instead of taking a 2-minute break between sets, reduce this time to 30 to 45 seconds.  This helps in burning more calories.  3  .  Focus on the larger muscle groups.  The bigger the muscle, the more calories needed to work and sustain it.  For an effective cutting diet and workout, focus on exercising the muscles in legs, abdominals, back, and chest.  4. Sleep more.",Okay.

My heart really didn't feel any different than it did before the ablation.  From week 23 through week 26 after, I was unable to run at all because I was traveling in Asia in places I did not want to push my luck because of the pollution.

Aerobic and Anaerobic Workout Skiing is a great aerobic as well as anaerobic sport as skiers use their momentum and bodyweight to ski.  The aerobic threshold is a relatively steady state of workout that you can perform for a longer duration of time without going out of breath.  Cross-country skiing lets you increase your aerobic threshold so that you can go for a longer duration.  The anaerobic threshold, on the other hand, is the point when your body switches from its aerobic metabolism to anaerobic one.

It is much more practical to use this number than the flight of stairs as the number of stairs in different flights may vary greatly.  On average, climbing a flight of 13 stairs takes about 8 seconds.  8 seconds = 8/60 of a minute = 0.13 minutes = 0.13/60 of an hour = 0.002222 hours.  Finally, you can calculate the answer: Calories burned = METS (4) x Weight (77kg) x Time (.00222 hours)= 0.68 calories.  So, you spend between 0.5 and one calorie while climbing one flight of stairs.  Doesn’t look a lot, but that’s just 8 seconds.  And it’s 4 times more than what you’d have burned by just sitting on your sofa scrolling through social media.  Shutterstock Does Running Stairs Help Burn Calories?

On the basis of Kennedy’s findings, the Democratic leadership of the Senate decided to hold hearings on Watergate.  The result was the creation of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, the Ervin Committee, through which the nation learned of the White House tapes the specific cause of the drive to impeach Nixon.

Last Friday, Sirica rejected the prosecution’s suggestion that he read the secret grand jury minutes of the case to find the answers to some of his questions, and said he would continue to interrogate witnesses when he felt it necessary.  He then ordered that testimony obtained by his own questioning of a key witness outside the presence of the jury, be read to the 12 members of the jury.

Perhaps the most popular theory is that Nixon was worried that O'Brien knew about his financial dealings with billionaire tycoon Howard Hughes, for whom O'Brien served as a lobbyist in addition to his DNC duties.  A large loan from Hughes to Nixon's brother had become an issue in the 1960 presidential race (which Nixon lost narrowly), and when Nixon took office in 1969, Hughes reportedly gave him $100,000 (about $650,000 today) by way of the president's friend Charles 'Bebe' Rebozo, some of which, a 60 Minutes report alleged, went toward Nixon's house in Florida.

After the five burglars were caught and the conspiracy was discovered—chiefly through the work of a few journalists, Congressional staffers and an election-finance watchdog official—Watergate was investigated by the United States Congress.  Meanwhile, Nixon's administration resisted its probes, which led to a constitutional crisis.   The term 'Watergate', by metonymy, has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration.  Those activities included such dirty tricks as bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious.

One of the men arrested in the break-in of the Democratic National Headquarters, James McCord, was a “security consultant” for the Central Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.) and “security coordinator” for the “Committee to Re-elect the President” meaning Nixon.  As later revealed, Watergate was only part of a vast array of break-ins, wiretaps, and sabotage connected to Nixon.  58 Nixon’s rationalization of the Watergate burglary was that this type of political behavior was not unique to him, except that he got caught.  In fact, in his first congressional campaign, all of his pamphlets were stolen in a break-in at Republican Party Headquarters in California.  The pamphlets, costing $3,000, had been purchased with money received from his wife’s sale of a piece of land.  59 Was Nixon’s conduct in political office pretty much standard or was it significantly different and unethical?

However, owing to his prestige, he still commanded great moral authority, and the presidency acquired a greater role than the framers intended.

Many people have become Christians through reading Morison’s book, including Lee Strobel the former atheist and investigative journalist.  1 Watergate’s Liars Colson contends that lessons from Watergate suggest that the eyewitnesses of Jesus’ resurrection were trustworthy and reliable.

Frank Wills, a security guard, discovered clues that former FBI and CIA agents broke into the offices of the Democratic Party and George McGovern months before the election.  These people listened to phone lines and secret papers were stolen.  When these men were found, it turned out that Nixon was involved and he had helped them cover it all up and might have even hired the men.  The Washington Post was a newspaper which played a big role in exposing the misdoings, specifically reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.  This showed the public that Nixon was not to be trusted, and society began to view him in a different light.  Nixon chose to resign from office on August 9, 1974 because he wished to not be impeached.  This means that he might have been charged with crimes.

Because the number of simulations run by a civilization capable of running them would be very great, if simulations are done, then the number of people that are simulated would be much greater than the number of people that are not simulated, which would mean that the probability that we are living in a simulated universe is almost unity.  So, it becomes clear that one of two things must be the case.  Either the probability that simulations are run is very small (practically null), or it is almost certain that we ourselves are living in a simulation.

The simulations he considered are different from those in movies like “The Matrix,” in which the world is simulated but the conscious minds are not—that is, where biological human beings with human brains interface with the simulated world.  In Bostrom’s simulations, human consciousness is just another figment of the simulation.  Bostrom assumes that the human mind is substrate-independent: that human consciousness isn’t strictly dependent on the biological brain itself, and that if we could physically replicate that brain in sufficient detail in another form (such as within a computer) it would also have the subjective experience of consciousness.  The replication doesn’t have to be perfect.  It just has to be good enough that the replicated being has a human-like subjective experience (a “mind”).

Even if high-fidelity computer Sims are never conscious, Dainton's reasoning leads to the following conclusion: either the fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage and are able and willing to run large numbers of neural ancestor simulations is close to zero, or we are in some kind of (possibly neural) ancestor simulation.",Which of Bostrom's 'simulation argument' trilemma is most likely?,test

If one assumes first that humans will not be destroyed nor destroy themselves before developing such a technology, and that human descendants will have no overriding legal restrictions or moral compunctions against simulating biospheres or their own historical biosphere, then, Bostrom argues, it would be unreasonable to count ourselves among the small minority of genuine organisms who, sooner or later, will be vastly outnumbered by artificial simulations.

In recent years, scientists have become interested in testing the theory.  In 2012, inspired by Professor Bostrom’s work, physicists at the University of Washington proposed an empirical experiment of the simulation hypothesis.  The details are complex, but the basic idea is simple: Some of today’s computer simulations of our cosmos produce distinctive anomalies — for example, there are telltale glitches in the behavior of simulated cosmic rays.  By taking a closer look at the cosmic rays in our universe, the physicists suggested, we might detect comparable anomalies, providing evidence that we live in a simulation.  Similar experiments were proposed in 2017 and 2018.  Professor Smoot captured the promise of these proposals when he declared, “You are a simulation and physics can prove it.”  So far, none of these experiments has been conducted, and I hope they never will be.  Indeed, I am writing to warn that conducting these experiments could be a catastrophically bad idea — one that could cause the annihilation of our universe.  Think of it this way.

Explain to your teen that we all have a negative inner critic that drives our thoughts at times.  The inner critic isn’t the problem; it’s what we choose to do with those critical thoughts that matter.  Share a few thoughts that run through your mind when your inner critic is loud.  Talk about how you feel as a result of those thoughts.  Finally, share ways you reframe those negative thoughts to refocus on positive thinking.  Helping teens learn to accept their negative emotions, state their negative thoughts, and reframe their thinking gives them the tools to cope with future rejection and other stressful events.  When we normalize the process, teens internalize these skills and are better able to use them when rejection occurs.  Rejection is inevitable, even if you, as a parent, try to avoid it for your child.

Anxiety and Depression Individuals with few opportunities to socialize with others often struggle with social skills.  This can often create a downward spiral effect for people with mental illnesses like anxiety or depression.  Due to anxiety experienced from concerns with interpersonal evaluation and fear of negative reaction by others, surfeit expectations of failure or social rejection in socialization leads to avoiding or shutting down from social interactions.

Waiting Visual cues such as objects, pictures, and written words can provide concrete information to make the concept of waiting less abstract and more specific to the situation.  Visual timers are also a simple and effective way to help children understand the concept of waiting.  Taking turns: Turn-taking can be taught through the use of social stories and by using a picture or pictograph to cue your child.  You may also need to teach turn taking when it comes to activities, not just speaking.  You can practice this by playing games and activities that involve 2 or more players and require taking turns.  For example, the card game “Go Fish” requires you to take turns playing and speaking but it’s also is predictable – You ask for a card, if the other player has the card, they’ll give it to the other, if they don’t they will say “Go Fish”.",How do I help to improve my son's social skills?,train

Very big.  It is full of a plethora of different people, places, and things.  We tend to think of the world in segments: countries, people, languages, cities, etc.  However, the world, when thought of as a whole, is a very interesting place in and of itself.  Famous bowls in India are also regularly found in Mexico.  The German Schnitzel is very similar to the Mexican milanesa.  As different as cultures are, there are also a ton of similarities.  Here are a few interesting facts that really help make our world a fun place to live.  There are over 6,000 languages spoken in the world today, many of which are spoken by fewer than a few hundred people.  The top 10 or 12 languages however make up the vast majority of all of the speakers in the world.  Mexicans celebrate New Years Eve by eating 12 grapes at the stroke of midnight.

The song was also included in the 1983 film Breathless.  The original Sam Cooke version of the song comprised the title soundtrack of the 2005 film Hitch .  After a Greg Chapman cover of the song was featured prominently in the 1985 film Witness in a scene where Harrison Ford dances with Kelly McGillis, 'Wonderful World' gained further exposure.  Particularly in the United Kingdom, where a copy of the song, produced by Karl Jenkins and Mike Ratledge and with vocals sung by Barbadian Tony Jackson, a backing singer for Paul Young, appeared in 'Bath', a well-remembered, Roger Lyons-directed 1985 advertisement for Levi's 501 jeans.  As a result, the Sam Cooke version of the song became a hit in the UK, reaching No.2 and selling a certified 250,000 copies.  In a 2005 poll by the UK's Channel Four the song was voted the 19th-greatest song ever to feature in a commercial.

In my book Wake Up to Wonder, I describe how parts of nature commonly found around the world – the sun, water, rocks, trees, and flowers – reveal more about the mystery of who God is and how we can relate to him.  Mysteries can spark your curiosity to seek God more – and when you do, you can encounter wonder that will expand your perspective.  Mysteries Show That God Values Lifelong Learning When you encounter a mystery, you’re challenged to go beyond the limits of what you know, what you understand, and what you think is possible.  Mysteries challenge you to step out of your comfort zone.  They call you to evaluate and expand the ways you think and feel, opening doors for you to walk through to wonder.

Keen released 'Wonderful World' in competition with RCA's issue of 'You Understand Me' in the same week.  'Wonderful World' quickly became Cooke's best-performing single since his first hit 'You Send Me,' reaching number 12 on the 'Billboard' Hot 100 and number two on the magazine's Hot R&B Sides chart.  'Billboard' reviewed the single upon its release, giving it four stars and writing, 'Moderate rocker gets a smooth belt from Sam Cooke in his usual, salable style.'

Although the comedy album boom was mushrooming by 1962, production of a record imitating the president met stiff opposition.  James Hagerty, a top executive for ABC-Paramount Records and President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s former press secretary, said the proposed album would be 'degrading to the presidency' and proclaimed that 'every Communist country in the world would love this record.'  After other rejections, Cadence Records agreed to take on the project, and within a month the record was appearing on store shelves, and seeing brisk sales.  Within two weeks it had sold more than 1 million copies, pushing past the debut album by Peter, Paul and Mary.

so today we have a guest that is an expert in this field it’s Katie Souza from expected and ministries and Katie you’ve been studying into this area of the soul and healing for the Soul for a long time now but not only studying you’ve actually been applying with your faith the redemptive power of Jesus Christ his healing blessing is his deliverance power and people are set free all over the world because of your ministry and so we’re just thrilled to have you with us today on the program and I know that you’ve got lots of good nuggets for us so let’s talk about the healing of the soul why is it important well for me it started out as necessity of getting this revelation because I was getting sick with all kinds of things reoccurring issues that would never go away at bladder infections yeast infections sore throats flus fevers and it seemed like I was doing what I’m supposed to do you know I was praying believing the crane and I wasn’t getting the breakthrough and so I knew there was something missing and I didn’t understand what it was and that’s when God began to you know speak to me through that scripture that will prosper and be in health even as our soul prospers and God began to show me how certain things like sin and trauma can wound our souls right you know isaiah 30:26 in the amplified talks about god healing up the brokenhearted and binding up their wounds that came from their sin right so saying that when we sin or when somebody sins against us or ancestors sin it can literally wound us okay and even like for trauma that traumas that we live through divorces losing jobs our children maybe someone passes away in our life those traumas can also wound our soul man you know and a good example of that and the Bible is job remember he went through a lot of trauma right he had all his servants killed and all his his wealth was stolen his children were all killed at the same time when a whirlwind you know crashed the house down on on them and then he himself even got sick physically well those traumas wounded his soul and we know that because throughout the entire book of Job 23 times he says stuff about his soul like I’m mourning and so on vexed and soul my soul is being poured out and it was always him making these statements in connection to the pain the soul pain he was feeling over those traumas and you know Katie if if your soul isn’t that much pain it’s going to affect your quality of life in the same way that if your body like has an injury like let’s say someone you know cut your your arm and you know your tendons are all damaged and everything else then that arms not going to function right and you’re not going to have quality of life so we can’t ignore this area of soul healing in the same way as we wouldn’t be able to ignore the need for a physical healing yeah and even doctors will say that when you live through a traumatic event or something has stressed you and your inner man they don’t even really necessarily call it my soul but they say that 80 to 90% of their patients that have a serious even a deadly illness right have suffered some sort of a event like that than traumatising to them so what happens in here directly affects everything out here including the physical body right and you know when as we go around teaching people how to get healed in their soul we see thousands and thousands of miracles I mean I saw a man grow a lung back right he lost from cancer win without soul healed Wow and I believe the soul the wound that was inside him actually caused the cancer in the first place yeah see a good a good biblical example of sickness and the soul is the man at the Pool of Bethesda remember him said he he had an infirmity for thirty-eight years right that’s a long time to be sick and a lot of people are in that situation exactly today yeah there’s so many mysterious illnesses that even the doctors don’t know how to diagnose because they don’t know how to diagnose the soul hmm I think that’s one of the issues right for the amount of the pool 38 years what was it that made him in that state for that long right well the Bible says he had an infirmity for 38 years if you look at that word infirmity in the Strong’s it means weakness and infirmity of the body and of the soul so was saying that he had wound inside of his inner man that was causing the sickness now where did that wound come front right well it came from sin and we know that from the words of Jesus himself when did he say that man after he got him healed he saw him in the temple he said I see your well now stop sinning right or something worse may happen to you see when we sin or someone sins against us or our ancestors sinned it can wound us and then cause disease right come upon us yeah for sure for sure even demonic oppression you know we see a lot of people you know they’re doing they’re making more with the enemy and and they’re doing what the Bible says to do you know no weapon formed against us shall prosper greater is He that’s in me than he that’s in the world the name of Jesus I command you to leave but they’re not having success or battling that spear and it’s not leaving it could be not every time but it could be because there is a legal landing strip is solely for that spirit to be there and a good example is the woman bowed over with the spirit of infirmity remember her 18 years right her spine is literally bent by a spirit a demon was bending her spine that is like almost beyond our ability to proceed right but nonetheless that’s what the Bible said right so what was allowing that spirit to literally affect her bones like that well it said she had a spirit of infirmity right the same word used to describe the man at the pool right it means infirmity and weakness in the soul right so she had something going on in here that allowed the spirit to be there once we get this healed we’ll start to see a lot of things change will start to see miracles happen in our bodies our minds our marriages our relationships our finances we’ll see our authority over demonic spirits will greatly increase right I mean today Katie you know like there’s a lot of I think frivolous thinking regarding sin issues in the body of Christ I see it everywhere it’s like oh well I’m under grace oh that’s fine it doesn’t matter you know but it really does and the reason why God hates sin so much is because it can damage you or it says it hurts us and he hates anything that hurts us so we don’t want to go navel-gazing as far as oh I’m going to keep looking because if your sin conscious that’s going to destroy you also yes it is but we don’t want to ignore the fact that right that our souls need to be rightly stewarded watch over are your hearts with all diligence because from it flow the issues of life scripture says it’s true you know just like simple things like being offended at somebody let’s say somebody really does you wrong and they really have hurt you and you’ve really not done anything to deserve it right what happens is some people mistakenly respond by becoming offended saying words that person I can’t believe what they did you know how they have the nerve you know they need to repent they’re completely wrong and we begin to complain and be offended well the Bible says in like proverbs 16 I believe it is or proverbs 26 it says the words of a slander or a whisper are like deadly wounds yeah that go down to the innermost part of the being so we think we have the right right you say stuff about this person because they did this and this and this and this right but we’re actually putting deadly wounds on ourselves and causing sickness point oh yeah one of the times I heard you speak on offense it was really enlightening because I think you were sharing a testimony about how you’re walking through an airport and going through the security lines and you’re offended because of you know someone not moving fast enough attending and you know so often things like that happened in all of our lives right every day but we we don’t even think its offense because you know it just feels like you know we’re you know we have a right to say it we have a right to think it I mean after all and it just becomes natural to us but God wants us to come to a place where we are so in tune with his love yes and with his purity and everything that that that will realize no that’s not his nature right it’s not him thinking gosh that’s why I’m feeling like that and so that we can walk free from woundedness by by by being in the healers love in the in in wholeness himself we gotta connect the dots I remember this gentleman in like San Diego he had a severe sinus affection and he had it for years and years and it was so bad it stunk okay was always running and you could smell it people around him could smell it was that bad why when talk about the soul at a meeting and about being offended and he said the prayers and he got instantly healed it dried up the smell left and everything and he was amazed because he never connected this horrible infection with him being offended and it wounding his soul Wow yeah it was amazing yeah well and so one round of repentance and cleansing cleansed everything yes it’s true oh and there’s another thing there too you know i lead people through repentance and that’s the first step we should always particular cross first because jesus died for every sin right including every sin that would ever wound us but there’s something i think that the body of christ is left out of their daily prayer life and that is for taking of something they already have and that’s Dunamis resurrection power that lives in them right so let me just explain what that is okay so the Bible talks about in Romans 1 that we that Paul said I’m not ashamed of the gospel which is the power unto salvation right he’s talking about this power that caused us to become saved born again it’s resurrection power it comes into us and it causes our dead spirit to be resurrected in the new eternal life right right okay will that power that Paul is talking about there in the Greek gets the word Dunamis now this is a this is an amazing power right okay Dunamis is resurrection power it causes us to be born again it comes and lives inside of us so right now every believer has a tankful that never runs out right okay well that word Dunamis if you look it up in the Strong’s one of its meanings is excellence of soul yes I love it so we don’t realize right now we got a tank full oh yeah power that can make us excellent a soul I can heal every single wound we already have it because Jesus is excellent of soul and he is eternal life and he’s dwelling within us and when you just think of like this excellence of Jesus and thought word and indeed lives in on the inside and the heat comes in fills our human soul oh that’s how we’re taken into his image his likeness because he’s living in there and he’s given us that power to heal every bit of woundedness that could ever come upon us when we talked about anything else that we do awesome yes you know we are going to come right back after this message but I want you to get ready to be ministered to we’re going to learn about the power of decree and how decrees can heal your soul there’s going to be miracles and we’re going to pray for those things and if you have need of a miracle right now maybe you have a an infirmity that you’ve lived with for a number of years don’t be surprised if you don’t get a miracle anointing this very day where every symptom lifts off of you we’ll be right back do you feel like your prayers aren’t getting through do you struggle with sickness financial difficulty or relational issues soul decrees by Katie Souza is

collection of downloadable resource it’s happened before revival fires fell and releasing massive waves of miracles healings signs and wonders setting hearts on fire gloria my present it is happening again twenty two speakers unite at the historic angeles temple to relight the revival fires and release an atmosphere of miracles signs and wonders it’s time for you to arise and be a woman on the front lines okay so Katie tell us more about this Dunamis power because it’s one thing to be able to you know recognize that there’s a need for repentance and that yeah but repentance is one thing but applying that Dunamis power is another yes you know you gotta know for sure that it works cuz Jesus used it that’s what acts 10:38 says God anointed Jesus Christ with Holy Spirit and power which is Dunamis and he went around healing everyone that was oppressed by the devil and when the woman touched Jesus’s the hem of His garment ruin oh right says he felt that healing virtue that word is Dunamis and she had been traumatized by that 12u her long says so I believe he healed her in her soul made her excellence all and healed her physical bodies and even if the issue of blood itself wasn’t related to the soul yeah the shame and everything that came with that condition would have damaged the soul and that’s what I loved about that whole story is that he presented her after she was healed he made sure publicly everyone knew that she was cleansed yeah it’s clear that whole issue I love to care everything he took care of everything Jesus all right now seriously okay so decrees is another good thing now you’re the decree expert you know I’ve read your book the trade and it’s awesome I think everyone needs to incorporate decrees it’s one of the simple ways that you can release the power you already have because if your blood you have and a decree is a governmental proclamation yeah we’ve got the King of Kings the word of the King of Kings that we decree and the the Bible says that when you send forth that word through decree you know that word does not return void it accomplishes everything it is sent to do so it’s powerful it’s active its operative as it says in Hebrews and is so powerful decrees are so powerful yeah you know job talks on we decree a thing and it shall be and she’ll be established so that helps establish and our healing for us in her soul and in her body right it’s so cool cuz you know Jesus made decrees when he would heal people you know he went around saying to people that were crippled and stuff arise right pick up your mat and walk he was releasing a decree to them except well that were to rise it’s so cool because if you look it up but it’s actually a resurrection term it’s the same term used for you know the when when Jairus daughter arose right and when Jesus command us go out heal the sick raise the dead so when he would say to people arise pick up your Matlock he was loosing a decree that was releasing the Dunamis he was carrying beautiful you know and it would heal that person in their in her soul and in their physical body right so that’s what we need to start doing too is start releasing decrees you know that’s why I wrote the book so that people could have a list of them if they didn’t know what to do that it’s called soul a soul decrees and so these are specific decrees to heal the soul and to empower the soul and to come into healing wholeness and an empowerment it’s awesome when they do them then the physical body will follow suit their marriage will follow suit you know every part of them will follow suit their finances will start to prosper right so it’s a good practice that’s a very simple but totally effective way is releasing the Word of God though that’s what James says the word has the power to save our soul yes you know that word say there is so so so it means holy deliver prosper yes awesome using we’ve seen so many things happen and in our in our you know meetings and in our personalized to and it happened through a decree right like I would get a word of knowledge and I would stand on the stage and make a decree say a scripture or say a decree you know I hear someone’s being healed of you know knee problems right now someone being healed of cancer I find and I would speak a scripture and I command that your soul would be prospered by health even as your body would be prospered and brought my health even as your soul prospers and then you know miracles that start to pop pop pop pop pop so it’s very simple for us to do this but so very powerful and Katie you actually have in your ministry you train people how to operate in this it’s not like you’re just up there on the platform doing this just yourself you actually equipped the body to do this and I know people have been under your training we’re out ministering to the sick feeling people’s souls casting out Devils all of that and so thank you so much for your contribution yeah because it’s amazing it’s been super fun but you know people don’t feel like they need me to lay hands on them because I’m teaching them how to do it right you know we’ve just even you know even in my own inner circle my staff and people in in my family in my ministry are getting huge miracles signs and wonders because they’ve learned how to do it you know one of my my very faithful employees john blake had a rare disease where he had ammonia storing in his brain right his body wasn’t releasing it and it would cause him like alzheimer’s like symptoms right he wouldn’t be able to remember remember simple tasks like typing he wouldn’t be able to finish his sentences his wife would have to finish him for him he wouldn’t be able to remember the plot of a movie even though he just watched the movie it was horrible he would spend like $1,500 a month on medications that would prevent him from going into a coma like sleep Wow it was terrible for him and God just released a word a nagy one day to us said it was his soul that there was an issue in the soul and then if we prayed for it it would be healed and he would be healed too and he came over the house and I just you know I prayed over him a decrese soaked him and within I don’t know probably 45 minutes he stood up and the first thing he recognized was that his mind was clear Wow he he could think so much clearer than he had in years and years and then he went home and all his life he’d had this smell of ammonia on his body and all of a sudden he gets in the shower to take a shower and it’s gone right he’s so convinced after the days you know past that he’s healed he has three of his doctors to give a test independently each one all comes back first time in years his ammonia level is normal it’s awesome it was awesome awesome a lot of times people think that you know like when the soul gets healed and then the physical body responds but it also affects other areas I can there John it says in every respect yes in all respects of life I want you to prosper and be in health even as your soul prospers so that could be also your prosperity of provision yes your prosperity of relationships and that and you’ve seen miracles in those areas as well especially in financial breakthroughs in people’s lives and you know as you yes you know seeing clearance in the area of the soul then other things come into alignment as well I’ve had huge financial miracles given to me and the ministry because I got my soul healed and it was so cool God would always connect the miracle with the provision coming in like something would happen I would have an awareness that there was an issue my soul like I’m sure most reviewers know my history I think I used to be a criminal in the streets I would rob people I knew in federal prison I was a federal prison I sold dope I was a collector I forced people to pay debts by gunpoint and I remember when the ministry started really taking off the Lord said you can’t continue to carry around those wounds in your soul that came from all that sin right because now I have to trust you to steward faithfully right and with integrity millions of dollar right and that’s no joke and we take that seriously I mean we’re members of the ECF a that’s how serious and I just want to say knowing you personally for like since you started in ministry really is I want to say how much I appreciate your integrity you’re a woman of virtue you are a woman who truly has watched over her soul and you watch over the finance of the ministry as unto the Lord in such a beautiful way and I want to commend you for that and your husband and your team we have gone out of our way we have independent audits done on us all the time to make sure that every eye you know is dotted every T is crossed and we’ve done really well in that we feel really happy that God has allowed us to work in that in that level of integrity but in all we can’t just say well let me just say this because I think this is so important there are so many Christiane’s you know you’re saved you’re you’re you know you you love the Lord but when you don’t watch over your soul in the area financial stewardship and when you don’t have integrity in that area how can we be trusted with true riches how can we really steward what God has us to Stewart so I just want you to examine your heart so you know and say am i stewarding my finances the way that God wants me to store them and especially if you’re a Christian minister and you are storing the funds that come into the ministry I know @xp we are very very serious about the way funds are handled and that nothing gets wasted and that we’re we’re careful with expenditures in that and so please you know I just make an appeal to you to make sure there’s alignment in that area and I think let me go to that see when we have woundedness inside of us it controls every part of our soul the way we think about the money the decisions we make with the money and we can even get emotional with the money and and we have to be healed in our soul right now in that parable of the talents remember the master leaves and goes his servants talents we said that he gave three of his servants talents according to their abilities right did you know that word ability there is the word Dunamis really well you can almost read it like this excellence of soul right it means that he gave them talents according to the exercise oh wow we have the Dunamis in notes we all have the same mana tournament yeah we all have a tankful that never runs out but how much of it is that working us right how much of in are we releasing how much are we going okay I I want to make sure I am totally operating with utmost integrity in my finances so I want and releases Dunamis I already have from my spirit in my soul to heal every wound in my soul that might be connected to finances right I repent for anything I’ve done you know bad stewardship wastefulness AXS extortion anything an enemy soul that needs money to make it feel good yeah you know the idolatry of it yes I remember some people there are adorable people that love Jesus they had gotten an inheritance and they called me so would you please help us decide what to to you know invest in and so I began to pray with them and I said you know I feel like you’re supposed to wait until you get more healing in your soul before you move on then that night the the wife has a dream she has a huge diamond and these zombies are trying to steal it from her she calls me and tells me the dream and I said oh my gosh it’s what I told you see zombies are the walking dead right that’s what soul wounds are there are things that are supposed to be dead but they’re still alive and kicking and they’re trying to eat your stuff Wow okay and I said they’re trying these soul wounds are gonna try to steal your diamond your watch don’t make a move until you get more healing they didn’t listen though and they lost it all oh they lost every penny we have to be so careful we need to be healed in here first yes then God will give us more finances because he can trust us and when you make decrees over your soul that actually helps fortify the healing though we just have a couple minutes left I love to minister to the people so why don’t you go as a spirit lead too and let’s release healing to soul wounds all right let’s work on the finances because so many people need help in that area let’s just ask God to first cleanse us of any sin we might have committed with our finances so why don’t we just pray together okay just say Lord Jesus our repent for anything sinful that I have done with my finances our repent for excess bad stewardship extortion gambling Ussery manipulation in Jesus name all sin I’ll repent for that’s connected to my finances I put the blood of Jesus on it I’m just saying into that okay now let’s do the second step because if you don’t if you don’t start releasing Dunamis in you you won’t become excellent of soul that wound will still be their sins gone but the wound stays behind controlling you okay so not just put your hand on your belly and just say Jesus I released what I already have I have a tank full of Dunamis and I release it now to go into my soul to every woundedness in me that’s controlling my finances send Dunamis into my mind so I think right thoughts about money send it to my will so I get healed and make right decisions about my money and send it into my emotions so I don’t make emotional decisions with my finances to say I release the Dunamis now decree I am excellent of soul in Jesus name Amen awesome thank you so much Katie we want to thank you so much for joining us on today’s program and I’d love for you to visit us at XP ministries.com and especially look up

to actually begin at the first verse and then I’ll try to call it out as I go but I’m excited for God’s a word thank you praise team band everybody for taking us into the presence of the Lord beginning at the first verse the Bible said sometime later the Moabites and the ammonites accompanied by the me unites they join forces to make war on Jehoshaphat verse 3 shaken Jehoshaphat prayed because sometimes when you really shake it to the cordless that’s what you do so shaken Joseph had prayed and he went to God for help and he ordered a nationwide fast the country of Judah United in seeking God’s help and they came from all the cities of Judah to pray to God go to verse 25 and when Jehoshaphat and his people came to carry off the plunder they found more loot than they could carry off equipment clothing valuables as a matter of fact it took three days to cart it away and on the fourth day they came together at the valley of blessing Baraka and they blessed God that’s how it got its name the valley of blessing now just a few verses earlier in verse three shaken some translations say was trouble he was worried he was bothered but here now just a few late verses later and there’s a whole lot of stuff that happened in between and I’m gonna try to hit the highlights of it today but I want to just talk for a few moments from a particular subject look to your neighbor on your right and say neighbor being overwhelmed by the battle – being overloaded by the blessing tell somebody else being overwhelmed by the battle to being overloaded by the blessing it all happened in a day’s journey from overwhelmed to overloaded well not just overloaded with troubles of burden of pressure but overloaded by the blessing sphere to God we thank you for your word it’s a timely word we honor you your word is always on time I pray for the anointing to deliver it into this room thank you for touching your people thank you for speaking confirmation in this house somebody came to hear have your way in here today God take over this room right now just take it over see what you want to say and do what you want to do and will thank you for it in Jesus name somebody just stand there for a second clap your hands and give God a praise in advance come on praise Him in advance for finding you today for speaking to you today for giving you a word that you can walk out here with and live with all week long thank you too dad god I thank you today for your word in Jesus name Amen and amen on your way down just hit somebody tell him from overwhelmed too overloaded overwhelmed to overload it y’all got to say Amen real loud because I can’t really see y’all good because the lights are in my face so I know you out there cuz of philia but say man every now and then thank you thank you y’all are awesome one of the most common complaints that that I hear or common phrases or common sentences or words that I hear today and probably you here too is is the phrase I am just over well over well now most of the time the people who say that they’re telling you the truth because there is a lot today that we can find ourselves overwhelmed by there’s this there’s just too many decisions that have to be made there’s one of the worst things I can stand it is when I you know cuz I will usually spend Saturday prepping for today and I come in here and preach this first service out preach second service and when church is over if my I can’t take it when my family looks at me and says where are we going to eat I just want to bop him upside the head cuz I haven’t been listening and hearing and I’ve been focused and I’ve been delivering and I made a I’ve made a hundred decisions in the last 24 hours if not more on what we’re doing right here right now and so the last thing that I want you to say to me is where are we going to eat so if you have a catering business we would love frite no I’m just kidding I’m just kidding most of the time I want to go home and go to bed because I’m just wore out but but I feel like it can just in case somebody one somebody make a decision on where we can go eat so that I can I can just walk out here and you say here’s where we’re going to eat today obviously nobody can do that so but the truth of the matter is is that there are so many decisions if you really stop to count the decisions that you make every day of your life you would be shocked to know how many decisions you make there’s just there’s there’s so many expectations that you that you and I feel like we have to meet there’s calls that have to be returned or you have to make the decision not to return the calls there’s there is request that you have to fulfill there are emails that you have to answer or you don’t answer and there are there are social media inbox messages so and then if that’s not enough on Instagram then you got to go to Facebook and they’ve got inboxes and we got so many boxes we’re about to be boxed in is what we’re about to be we’ve got friend requests that we should answer we’ve got and then when we go home and sit down and turn the TV on we have too many channels to choose from I just just overwhelmed I’m like when I was a kid we had three channels abies CBS and NBC that was it and they went off at two o’clock in the morning but they like that today and now we got so many things and then when you do decide to go somewhere to eat some of these restaurants there the menus are so complicated you just want to shut it like don’t even go to the Cheesecake Factory I’m just telling you never go there when you’re tired and when you’re really hungry because you’re just like what what is all of this right here you know I I got tickle s yesterday because I was reading a story about this woman who said that she she said I moved into a new apartment and I was glad to begin there and that by the time I’m getting everything unloaded unpacked I realized I don’t have a toilet brush for the bathroom so she said I went to Amazon and I started looking for a toilet brush she said do you know they sell on Amazon they sell 1161 different kinds of taller brushes now imagine that she said after about an hour of comparing the brushes and comparing the price difference in the brushes and reading all the conflicting reviews that came with all of the brushes she said I finally just got up got dressed I jumped in my car I drove to the local dollar store I walked in and I bought the only brand of toilet brushes that they sold there’s so many options and the more that our options increase our level of certainty about our choices begins to decrease because when you you make a choice you say okay I’m gonna use this I’m gonna take that and but because you have so many options you’re like I don’t know I I don’t know if that’s what I should do or if I should and the next thing you know you’re just consumed she said I wasted an hour just looking at all the reviews and the prices and comparing and I just wanted to toll it rush nobody was gonna see if it was just a toilet brush I mean it’s crazy the options that are out there today have you went to the coffee aisle in the grocery store Lee I mean if you’re a if you’re a newcomer to coffee you are gonna be confused as I don’t know what because there are so many options that are in how about toothpastes have you ever looked at how many options we have with toothpaste listen I just want spearmint I want peppermint all right I just want gel I want pace listen why do I have to go through all of that stuff just give me something that will help me and help people that come in contact with me and God forbid that you ever get a cold because if you ever have to go to the medicine aisle listen you go to the medicine aisle they say do you want something for runny eyes or do you want something for runny nose do you flu symptoms or do you have a cold is your ears burning or are they tingling or are they ringing is this your sinuses or is this your allergies or do you want non-drowsy or drowsy do you want 12 hours or do you want 24 hours what do you want I want you to go away that’s what I want seriously it can be totally overwhelming I mean I used to think Baskin Robbins 31 flavors was overwhelming it’s a breeze now when I was a kid I thought it was overwhelming because as I grew up we only had chocolate or vanilla and occasionally we would have Neapolitan does anybody know any apologies all my old folks they know what that is that’s that’s that’s when you get all three vanilla chocolate and strawberry so those are fun things that we can laugh about it comes to being overwhelmed but there are some serious things today that are overwhelming people people are overwhelmed by their debt it seems like just it’s just overwhelming the way especially if you have credit card debt how it can just the compound interest and god forbid that we would ever oh that I rs anything because they’re gonna get compound interest they’re gonna get penalties they’re gonna get all of that stuff people are overwhelmed student loans they they are there they’re overwhelmed by child care costs like I have to have a family I want to have a family but I make it costs me just as much to put them in in daycare as it does I feel sorry for kids today people today I didn’t have all those options when when my kids were coming up and but to think about it today it gets overwhelming people get overwhelmed by health care costs like do I do I do I do I pay for my medicine or do I repair the roof that’s over my head you know it’s just it gets overwhelming and then and then yours there’s your workload you’ve got to work and you got this load and just as soon as you think you have got your desk pretty much cleared off here comes about a truckload of other things and next thing you know it’s out of control people are overwhelmed by regret they’ve been through stuff then it’s it and they’ve got so much regret that it just stays present and forefront in their minds they’re over there overloaded by shame they’re overloaded by guilt they’re overloaded by worry and by fear some people are overloaded by the by the lack of security they want to be and want to have more security overwhelmed by pain overwhelmed by loss overwhelmed by anger overwhelmed by by grief overwhelmed by resentment and bitterness overwhelmed by the conflict between you and your kids or if everything’s good between you and your kids it’s between your kids and your kids and it’s just so much so so much as it’s causing us to be overwhelmed should we stay here should we move should we do this should we do that it’s it’s it can be absolutely overwhelmed it if you weren’t overwhelmed when I got up you’re overwhelmed right now overwhelmed in our families overwhelmed in our marriages we’re living in the same house but we’re also living in two different worlds it can be overwhelming what do you do when you find yourself overwhelmed and so today that’s that’s what I want to talk about in the man that’s gonna help me talk about that is that I I really like him he’s a cool guy his name is Josh AFET I mean listen a name like that is overwhelming can you imagine can you imagine when you go to kindergarten please spell your name spell jaws how many syllables in my name that’s overwhelming can you imagine what he what he felt like when he had to write and imagine his nickname think about that people that didn’t want to call him Joe ha stuff that they probably just called him Jay fat or fat you know it’s just that’s overwhelming in and of itself hello can Jay fat come out and play today it’s crazy but I really like Jehoshaphat I like him because he’s a good guy he was a good King and he is a really good leader he had a strange name and I don’t know why his mother did that but anyway I hope you’re naming jaha’s have had him here today just come down here right now I’m gonna pray for you so the Bible tells us that that he was a great leader he led the entire nation of Israel into a revival it was it was just a reviving that he brought death to them and in second chronicles 19 and 4 the Bible says that King Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and he went among the people from bear Sheva to the mountains of Ephraim and he brought them back to the Lord God of their fathers he went to all of the little cities he didn’t just go to the big cities he went to all the little cities he went to where the real people lived and he got down with him and he hung out with him and by doing this he caused them to turn their hearts back to God you would be amazed to know just how far it how far reaching your willingness to come to where people are what would really go it could possibly cause them to turn their hearts back to God and so because of his efforts that he was a great success and there was a great spiritual awakening that came to Israel it was really he and the spiritual awakening was very good for the nation of Israel however we all know that that good is often going to be followed by something bad if we can just be honest today it’s a good time but you can’t hardly enjoy the good time for fear of what the bad time is going to bring we know that for every mountaintop you can always expect that there will be a valley we know that with every high somewhere there’s going to be a low we know that with every setup there’s probably somebody waiting in the wings to set you back it’s just life it’s it’s it’s how it’s it’s how it is there’s always the day after the wedding everybody looks forward to the wedding it’s exciting you build to order but then there’s the day after when it’s all over if there’s the day after Christmas we’re excited about Christmas but then you wake up the next day after Christmas and your kids are already bored and you don’t spend a thousand dollars on a little toys and they look at you and say can we go to Chuck E Cheese you know it’s it’s the day after the Super Bowl party everybody’s excited on the day but then there’s the day you wake up and it’s over how about the New Year’s Eve party everybody’s excited New Year’s Eve it’s all changing we’re getting everything behind us hallelujah but then you wake up in is January 1st and we’re just back to our routine so on a personal note I I have noticed that on the heels of most every one of my life’s greatest blessings or greatest achievements or greatest victories or one of my life’s greatest testimonies right on the heel heels of that there will always come a test anybody ever noticed that it’s just you no sooner get through celebrating till you realize oh shoot I’m in the middle of another test and this this particular happens it particularly happens when we make a fresh commitment to God anybody ever made a fresh commitment to God you’re in church on Sunday and you’re excited tears are rolling down your face you feel God you’re like God I’m gonna be I’m gonna change my life bringing my life into alignment with you I’m getting my house in order Cod I’m gonna get it all together and and next thing you know here comes a test without fail that happens and and sometimes the test comes through people that you love because not everybody is happy about your commitment to Christ and somebody is going to challenge your decision the enemy’s going to always make sure that somebody is there to challenge your decision somebody is gonna be angry because you have made up in your mind I’ve changed uniforms today I’ve changed sides I’ve changed ugly gence as I am in the Lord’s army today somebody is going to be upset at that upset about that because anytime you are the friend of God you are the enemy of Satan it just happens to work like that and and so that’s that’s what happens here that’s what was happening here in second chronicles chapter 20 and verse 1 it says in the King James or in the New King James it says after this after this after what after after the spiritual awakening happened that I just told you about after this the armies of the Moabites the ammonites and some of the Mia Knights declared war on Jehoshaphat of course they did because we just come through a great celebration so he is the king of a small country called Israel and three of his his enemies that get together and they decide that they’re going to gang up on him you ever felt like the life just ganged up on you maybe I’m preaching to the wrong Church by I’m gonna find somebody else to preach this to cuz they’ll get it I said do you ever feel like life just has ganged up on you so then the Bible says then then some messengers came and they told you Hoss effete in an inner that a great multitude or a huge combined army is coming against you and they’re coming from the Dead Sea and Jehoshaphat starts feeling overwhelmed because his enemies are ganging up on him and and I and I know it that’s that’s like sometimes you feel like I don’t know where you’ve been hit on the right and then as soon as you’re like pulling yourself together from that here comes something out on the left and and you’re being hit on every side by by the enemy and it seems like everything was going right but now it’s all going wrong at the same time anybody know what I’m talking about anybody had a week like that so that’s what King Jehoshaphat was feeling and things were going good the nation was was in revival all of a sudden he hears that the three armies of his enemies have United together and they are on their way to destroy him so now he’s facing a triple threat and he did just to be honest he’s a king but he is overwhelmed the Bible says that shaken Jay said yeah that’s what I’m gonna call him Jay fat said himself to seek the Lord he’s overwhelmed he’s scared and he’s shaken but look what he does he sets himself to seek the Lord he went to God for help and he also ordered that the entire nation make a sacrifice and begin a fast now there’s a lesson right there in that all by itself wouldn’t you feel overwhelmed by a problem do not let that problem intimidate you but make it motivate you to pray more okay why why should I be intimidated when I can be motivated look at somebody and say don’t be intimidated be motivated I’m overwhelmed but at the same time I’m more motivated to seek God in prayer I’m motivated to trust him more I’m motivated to believe more I’m motivated to depend and lean upon him more I’m overwhelmed but I’m also expecting more so you won’t either do one of the other you’ll be intimidated and you’ll back up or you’ll say oh right and you’ll become motivated and you’ll get yourself ready for whatever you have to get yourself ready so the first thing that Joseph had does is he makes it a matter of personal prayer the second thing that he does is he gets not only himself but he tells the whole nation around him to pray I want you to look at your neighbor and say neighbor I dare you to pray about it now look at that same neighbor and say back to their neighbor I dare you to pray about it see well what I want to pull from this story today there are five things that I’m gonna give you that Jehoshaphat did when he felt overwhelmed so if you are in this place get your iPad get pin get something out because I’m gonna give you something to take home with you today because I want you to put this in practice every time that you feel as if you are overwhelmed and and you know what if you don’t feel like you’re overwhelmed today take this down anyway cuz one of these days you’re gonna wake up and see where is that message pastor Brady was preaching about being overwhelmed so I want you to write this down what do you do when you’re overwhelmed the first thing that Jay fat did what he did I person said it the first thing that Jehoshaphat did when he let me say it like this there are five things he did and they worked for him and I would almost stake my life on it today that what I’m getting ready to tell you if that they work for him but they’re gonna work for you too I’m telling you I’m convinced up there there are five thinks the first thing that there are five right moves that he made when he was overwhelmed when you’re overwhelmed you can’t afford to make a wrong move so I need you to write this down the five write loses one of the first write moves he made was he turned to God write that down the first right move he made was he turned to God he didn’t turn to friends he didn’t turn to his military capabilities he didn’t turn to his weapons he didn’t turn to human reasoning he didn’t turn to social media to take it out on social media he didn’t turn to to rant to anybody he didn’t turn to his followers he didn’t start developing a plan there’s nothing wrong with the plan everybody needs a plan but before you develop a plan you need to pray and as you pray God will give you his plan and not your plan okay so you’ve got to turn to prayer before you turn to your plan prayer should be our first choice and not our last resort I said prayer should be our first choice and not our last resort oftentimes we wait till we get to the point where prayer is the last thing that we can do we’ve all heard people say well all we can do now is just you’re heard somebody say that before all we can do now is just pray we’ve done tried everything we know and so all we’re gonna do right now is we’re just gonna put it in the hands of God and we’re going to pray no we should have prayed before you ever done anything else prayer should have been our first choice and not our last resort I’m so most say until somebody hears it today God is saying you’re not praying to me you’re asking everybody else you’re trying to work it in your head you’re trying to figure out how you can do it you’re trying to make your next move and God said stop a minute and talk to me about it you should go straight to God and say God I got trouble coming from everywhere I’ve got financial trouble I’ve got to help him tails issues I got family trouble I got emotional trouble Lord I’m spiritually in trouble and I need your help somebody said I need your help that’s what Jay Joseph had did Jehoshaphat said not only am I gonna pray about it he said but I’m gonna get this entire nation to pray he said the country in in verse 4 in the message he says the country of Judah United in seeking God’s help they came from all of the cities of Judah to pray to God see once it gets the whole nation to pray once it gets gets everybody all the national leaders to come together and pray then he opens up his mouth okay first he’s just praying to God second he gets everybody else in there to pray with him but then when everybody gets there he publicly opens his mouth and he starts calling on the name of the Lord sometimes you can’t just pray in your head and you can’t just bring in your heart sometimes you got to open your mouth and let everybody around you hear you call on God sometimes he wants to hear your voice and then good enough for me to pray for you some situations you got to pray for yourself he did that that’s leadership right there that’s amazing leadership right there if we could get some of our political people our spiritual people our social leaders our local leaders our national leaders to come together and pray to lay aside denomination and pray just set aside our differences and pray to put our logos and our egos in the floor and just begin to pray I believe that we would hear from heaven did somebody say man right there cuz there’s no problem that is too big and there is no problem that is too small for us to pray about if it’s big enough for you to worry about it’s big enough for you to pray about hallelujah so I want to teach you exactly how he prayed because I believe that if you’ll apply this to your life when you’re overwhelmed let’s go work for you too so so what did I say the first thing he did was he turned to God for help okay and then in verses all the way down from verses 6 to verses 12 he asks God for questions he asks are you not do you not is there not will you not each one of those requests was a way of praying to God because of of heat because of the fact that he was under attack so the first thing he said that the Bible says he did he turned to God in prayer the second thing that he did was he focused on God and not the problem now hear me I know that’s going right over your head today and you’re adding think about going in one ear and out the other but I dare you to apply this to your life he’s focused on God and not his problem have you have you have you asked anybody the question like have you ever just looked and say hey how are you doing and their answer is B will be like well under the circumstances I’m doing okay well number one why are you under the circumstance you need be on top of the circumstances okay not on dirt but on top all right circumstances are like a mattress if you get on top of it you’ll rest if you get underneath it you’re gonna suffocate tell somebody to get on top get on top so when you need when you pray you need to turn your focus off of the problem and turn your focus on to the solution turn your focus on to God and if you continue here’s why because if you continue to look at the negative if you continue to focus on the problem where the focus goes the power flows and what was little becomes big big big big and bigger so if you focus on the lack the black is gonna get bigger if you focus on the problem the problem will get bigger if you focus on the negative all the negativity is going to get bigger and you will continue to feel overwhelmed so Jehoshaphat made the decision in prayer and he asked it for ways I told him to put I got my notes y’all gotta up up under number two I want you to write a B C and D here’s the four ways he did it when he began to pray the Bible said he remembered how big God was he remembered how big God was the bigger you realize how you’re God the bigger that you recognize how big your God is the smaller your your problem is going to become your problem is going to shrink when God expands in your life do you understand that when God gets big the problem gets small so you me and here’s why because he is all-powerful he is always in control he is all-knowing there is nothing that is too hard for him and with God all things are possible so he said in verse 6 are you not God in heaven this is how this man is praying are you not God in heaven do you not rule over the kingdoms of the nations and is your hand and in your hand is there not power and is there not mine so that no one is able to withstand you when’s the last time you went to God like that he called God out that’s exactly what he did he’s saying yeah I’ve got some problems but I know this I know that you are bigger than my problems so he remembered how big God was second thing he did is he remembered what God had done in the past well write that down you gotta remember what God has done in the past he said I realized that I’ve been in tough times and tight places before but I also know that I’m still here I know that I have survived them I know that I have come through them I know that I have outlasted them I know that I have outlived them because I know and whom I have believed and I and persuaded that he was able and if that God did it from me then the same God that did it for me then is gonna do it for me right now look at somebody say he’ll do it again so he said in verse 7 he says Oh God did you not drive out those who lived in this land before you brought your people Israel here he’s reminding God you did this before he’s saying hey aren’t you the one that brought us here we didn’t even come here ourselves we didn’t ask to be here you’re the one that established us you brought us in and you brought us in through Abraham and then we went down into Egypt and we got enslaved for 400 years and when Moses brought us back did you not take care of those enemies for us then and now they’re trying to return and here we are trying to get in our homeland and you took care of them you wiped them out from us and now God here they come again he says you took care of them back then and you took care of them in my past you won’t take care of them in my future do you hear the confidence he’s saying I know who you are and I know what you’re able to do if you don’t know that in your belly then you’ll never get anywhere in God but you at some point you’ve got to say I know you are and I know what kind of power you had you need to remind yourself when you are feeling overwhelmed that one God is a big card and number two if he helped you before he will help you again and then I love how he starts recollecting this in verse 9 he said you helped us when we face disasters you were there for us when we were in wars you there went disease hit us you were there when we were facing famine he said I remember how big you are I remember what you have done and here’s the third one I remember what you promised well look at your neighbor and say neighbor you got to know what he’s promised there are 7,000 promises in the Word of God and a sure sign that you don’t know what God has promised to you is the fact that you worry you can’t worry and believe his promise at the same get somebody tell him I believe God I believe God Jehoshaphat said God I know how I know you’re big I know what you’ve done and I also know what you promised does anybody know what God has promised you he said I know what you promised and because of that he said I’m up staying on your promise did he did you not give this land to your friend Abraham and to his descendants and did you not give it to us forever you did not put a time frame on this you said this was ours forever didn’t you promise this property to us did you say this was our land didn’t you say this was our parking lot did you say this was our church didn’t you say this was my house did you call it the promised land on purpose so I want to know how you gonna keep your word God are you gonna let these three enemies come in and try to wipe us out he’s overwhelmed but his confidence is coming back I can hear it he said I remember how big you are I remember what you’ve done and I remember what you promised fourth thing he said I remember your character he said I know what kind of God you are I know that you’re a good god I know that you’re a faithful God I know that you’re a loving God I know that you’re a fair God I know that you’re an honest God I know that you are just and I know that you are even-handed so here let me really quick in one minute give you just a little backdrop to this story for hundreds of years earlier when Moses got the Jews out of slavery and started brought them back to the promised land there were three tribes that had already moved in while Israel had been enslaved three tribes and their names were the Amorite the Moabites and the me unites and God specifically told the Jews as he was bringing them in don’t worry about them don’t fight them let them live right there leave them alone let them stay where they are he said I don’t want you to fight them I don’t want you to wipe them out I don’t want you to get into this battle because this battle is not yours just leave them on the right side of the Jordan so now you’re up to date a hundred years later there are three tribes and now they are uniting together attempting to try to destroy Israel are you kidding me we could have wiped you out when we came back but we let you live their wing charge you no rent we you stay right where you were we were obeyed God we could have killed you but we’ll let you live and now you gonna get together and act like you don’t kill us you are kidding me so you know it’s awesome that does he immediately goes to appealing to the character of God and he does it in verse 10 in verse 12 and he said look here you didn’t let us touch them when we got here at first we detoured around them we did not lay a hand on them and now they have come to kick us out of the country God that you gave us oh dear God won’t you take care of them we are helpless before these vandal hordes ready to attack us we don’t know what to do we are looking unto you so do you see what Jehoshaphat is doing right there he’s saying God I don’t know how to fix it but I’m turning to you I’m overwhelmed I don’t have the answers there is no way I am going into battle because the odds are against us it’s three armies two one if I take our armies in there their army in there that we are going to lose so I’m turning to you and I’m choosing to focus on you and I’m gonna focus on the problem promise and not the problem but but he said in doing so I’m gonna remind you number one how big you are you’re all-powerful you’re all knowing you’re all able you’re capable number two I’m gonna remind you what you’ve done for me in the past you’ve been there before you helped us out of tighter places than this I’m gonna remind you number three what you promised us about our future I’m calling you out on the gaudy then you said it or you didn’t either you gonna do it or you’re not going to it and I’m asking you God keep your word keep your word to my family keep your word to my household keep your word keep your promise to me and number four he said I’m I’m gonna ask you to fulfill your character I’m gonna asked you to be who you are well okay so y’all got that all that is up under number two I ain’t got time to wait I gotta keep moving so the thing that Jehoshaphat did that was right that you got to do what I got to do that’s right his number one he turned to God for help number two he focused on God and not the problem the third thing that he did that was right he admitted his inability he admitted his inability the first step toward victory in any area of your life is to come out of denial and admit that you can’t fix this I can’t do it on my own I can’t get out of debt on my own I cannot find a job on my own I cannot pay back these school loans on my own I can’t raise these kids on my own I cannot face retirement on my own I’m overwhelmed and I am admitting to you my in abilities that’s what that goes all the way back to that thing that gives you grace when you come before God and say I’m gonna tell you people think I got it together but the truth is I ain’t got it together I can’t fix it if you don’t help me if you don’t fix it it’s not going to be fixed he said we are helpless and we don’t know what to do what is he saying right there he’s saying we don’t have the power and we don’t have the knowledge oh it’s hard to admit that you don’t have the power and you don’t have the knowledge you are the king you’re that king of your world and you find it hard to go to God and say look I’m powerless I’m helpless and I don’t know how to do this and I love what the next verse says he said now all of Judah this was the real men with their little ones who with their wife’s so they weren’t ashamed they didn’t have these milli goes okay cuz they knew what they were in trouble they let their wives and their children see them calling on the name of Jesus they stood before God together and the wives just didn’t wait on the husband’s the wife’s began to pray out to God cover our house cover our family cover our children why because if one of us can put a thousand to flight two of us can put ten thousands of flight and the Bible said that the whole Potter’s House Lord I mean the whole nation started calling on the name of the Lord what do you do when you’re overwhelmed hit somebody and tell them get honest before God my marriage looks like an angle make it God this dream looks like you will never come to pass the plans that I have are all jacked up I need you to help me if you don’t help me I’ll never get a harvest if you don’t help me I’m not gonna make it so what do you do when you’re overwhelmed you pour your heart out you poor young nuts out and you surrender everything to God you turn it over to him and you trust him and when you do here’s how God responds he said in the fifteenth verse he said listen all of you are Judah you inhabitants of Jerusalem and you took King Jason thus says the Lord to you don’t be afraid but that it happened till he got honest that didn’t happen until he was got honest privately and he got honest publicly it’s sad when your title won’t let you access the help that’s right in your house in your home in your business and your family because you got to keep being who you are defeat it at all but when he cried when he gathered people around him that have the same heart the same mind the same vision the voice of the Lord begin to speak do not be afraid don’t be dismayed because of this great multitude why why why are you telling me that because this battle is not yours this battle is God well listen to me I’m your pastor I love you I want your marriage to make it I want your children to make it I want you to make it I want you to get out of debt I want you to get to where you can live comfortably in God but I’m gonna tell you the truth and I can tell you because I know what I’m talking about the reason that were stressed out the reason that we’re exhausted the reason that our marriages are falling apart the reason that we’re weary in well-doing the reason that were checked out the reason that were wore out the reason that were burned out is because we are trying to fight battles that are not ours to fight you’ve got a discern what is your battle and what is the Lord’s you don’t have the energy you don’t have the knowledge you don’t have the power and the reason that we’re feeling frantic about all of this stuff is because we’re trying to be God we are not God God is God I said God is God God is saying did I ever ask you Jos a pet to fight these three armies Oh No haven’t I always taken care of you yeah you’ve always taken care of us haven’t I made some promises to you well I don’t know who I am talking to today and who God brought me here to preach to but I came to tell somebody that God brought me here to tell you that this battle is not yours this battle is the Lord’s this problem is not your yell that big thing that’s in your face right now God said that thing right there this ain’t your battled this ain’t your problem this is not your situation it’s not yours to fix it is God’s to fix and if you stop trying to fix what God has not called you to fix then you will stop being a failure because you’re in over your head and God said I want you to humble yourself I’m wanting you to swallow your pride and I’m wanting you to invite me into your struggle but we keep failing oh god I’m such a failure I messed up I’m so sorry hold up you did not let me down cuz you never held me up to begin with I won’t tell you that right now oh you ain’t that powerful see some of us you have you ever have you ever have you ever sat on a plane and you know it’s getting ready to run down it’s going down the runways getting ready to take off have you ever just started flapping your wings like it was your responsibility for that plane to take off some of you are exhausted right now because you’re walking around flapping your rings trying to get your dream off the ground trying to get your business off the ground trying to get your relationships off the ground you’ve been flapping so hard and you have been doing so long that now you’re about to give up you’re about to throw in the towel you’re about to quit hello and God is saying right back to you uh listen go ahead quit in whatever you know whatever you need to do he said it’s about time it’s about time you give up because that is not the strategy I gave you the strategy I gave you is something different and if you start trying to make it happen and just let it happen you will find out that you got some jet engines attached to you and those jet engines will do all the lifting tell somebody let God do the heavy lifting you’re slapping and all you’re flapping in the world is never going to be enough come on somebody repeat this with me God is God and I’m not God is God and I’m not close your eyes and say it God is God and I I am NOT God the Sun in verse 17 you will not need to fight in this battle look at somebody and tell him it ain’t your battle position yourself he said you ain’t gonna have to fight but this is what you’re gonna have to do position yourself stand still but stand still and see us you know what salvation means the complete deliverance spirit soul and body stand still and see the salvation of the Lord who is with you old Judah is with you all Jerusalem and that happened Jeff had bowed his head and with his face to the ground and all Judah and all of the inhabitants of Jerusalem they bow down before the Lord and they started worshiping the Lord he’s saying boy you can worry or you can worship you can panic or you can praise you can run or you can rest and sometimes it takes more courage to do nothing than it does to do something be stale rest relax and stand firm here’s the fourth thing I got a stop for a thing that he did what was right he thanked God in advance but verse 21 after talking it over with the people Jehoshaphat appointed aquire for God so he’s like ok just say not battle but this is our opportunity to worship I want you to sing and I want you to sing and I want you to say and the Bible said that he he we dressed them in holy robes they even had they even had choir robes Thank You Hafsah fans today and he said I’m dressed him in holy robes and they were to march ahead of the troops and they were to sing and to give thanks to God because his love endure it forever so you got the army back here and you got the choir out there that’s Judah out there and you got the fighter back here look at somebody say sends you the first since universe send you Bray’s out first that’s what he was doing he was sent the praises out in advance and oh hear me today Church and when you start to thanking God in advance for miracles I’m telling you God tells miraculous sometimes we gotta stand still and say thank you sometimes we gotta stand there and when we want to move we gotta resist the urge to move and say nobody it’s my job just to say thank you and the Bible said as in verse 22 as soon as they started praising and shouting to God somebody say at that moment at that moment if you were smart you would be like oh god I just thank you right now that moment God sets ambushment against the men of Amnon against Moe who did it who did it they didn’t have to do it God did it and as they were as they sang the men of Amnon of Moab and Mount Sierra as they were attacking Judah they started attacking Judah they started attacking the praises and next thing you know God got involved and all of them ended up dead can y’all pull it up can y’all pull up verse 24 verse 24 pull it up on the screen so it saved me a minute’s time verse 24 hello okay so when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness they looked toward the multitude and they were dead bodies these are the people that were coming after us keep it going keep it going there were dead bodies they had fallen on the earth and no one had escaped keep going and when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil they found among them an abundance of valuables on the dead bodies did somebody say I’m going in for the kill I’m going in for the kill there was precious jewellery which they stripped off for themselves more than they could even carry away and they were that for three days you’re alone three days three days they were saya three days just gathering up the spoil and they did that because there was so much keep going keep going and on the fourth day they assembled in the valley of Baraka for their they bless the Lord I bet you better bless the Lord therefore the name of that place was called the valley of Baraka until this day keep it going and then they returned every man of Judah and Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat in front of them so it was Judah in front of them now Jehoshaphat is there he said Jehoshaphat said to them go back to Jerusalem and boy y’all better go back with joy I’m telling somebody in this place when you go home today you better go back with joy why why because the law I had made them rejoice over their enemies keep going so they came to Jerusalem and they got strained instruments they got harps they got trumpets and they took it to the house of the Lord and the fear of God was on all the kingdoms I bet there was the kingdoms whose countries when they heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel keep going then the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet why in other words all of his enemies shut up because God I don’t I don’t know for in the message version because I think mine reads a little bit different but all of his enemies shut down why cuz they heard about how not how they fought they’re better yeah see people might be a match for you they’re not a match for your God here’s the fifth one and I gotta stop here’s the fifth thing that he did that was right that you gotta do he discovered the blessing in the middle of the bed one of the things that happens when you stop flapping your wings and you stop trying to make things happen and you stop pretending like you are God and like you are so in control of your own life as you get blessed beyond measure God took them from the valley of the battle over to the valley of baracan that means the valley of blessing from the valley of the battle to the valley of the blessing God wants to give you so much that you have to share it with other people just imagine that just imagine that for a minute don’t let that go over your head Ino out your ear can you imagine God flipping the script in your life in a 24-hour period I’ve read you the Bible today I this is not my story this is God’s story this is what I’m telling you he flipped that script they got the prophetic word they went to sleep they got some rest then they got up and they got the victory they went from being overwhelmed by the burden to overloaded by the blessing and let me tell you somethin verse 27 can you pull up verse 27 for me in verse 27 the Bible said they were then they returned every man of Judah and Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat in front of them to go back to Jerusalem with joy for the Lord had made them rejoice over their enemies in other words it wasn’t they themselves who got the victory this was hand given to them God did this for them you know there are some battles that when you win you’re so exhausted from the fight because there is a fight that I’m not to fight right out of you there’s some battle you win but you’re like I need time to recover before I can enjoy what I want not this time they got the spoils they went back home rejoicing what was the difference this battle was the Lord’s they didn’t earn it they didn’t fight for it they didn’t beg for it they didn’t buy it all they did was just receive it because when you do those five things y’all got all of them can we put them up just put them up on the screen real quick one two three four five one two three pray about it thank you he focused on God and not the problem he admitted his inability he thanked God in advance and he discovered the blessing in the bad y’all got that come on jump up on your feet all over the building just look at somebody and tell him I’m going after the

neighbor not my friend not my buddy not my mama not I put my daddy I’m getting a call out God and I’m gonna look at bad things and I’m most searched until I find the good things there were dead bodies everywhere they climbed over the bad days and they got the rings off that finger and they got the jewelry off their neck are y’all here at me be careful that you don’t throw away the bad cuz your blessing might be right in the middle of it and sometimes you gotta be willing to say hmm this is a little weird but give me what belongs to me this is mine hear this I got a stop here this right here they didn’t come after the enemy when they got back to their land and realized they had been inhabiting that place God said don’t touch him because there’s a time there’s a time frame be careful what you try to uproot outside of the timing of God hello don’t stir up the devil if you can’t cast him out all that means is you gotta get before God and you got to hear him more clearly but if you will

But RPM/Kent retained many unreleased King masters, and over the years the company released them, thus forcing King to compete with himself.  The most successful of these releases was 'Rock Me Baby,' a blues King wrote with Joe Josea and recorded in about 1958.  The lyric is a basic plea for sex -- 'Rock me all night long' -- while the music provides a blues structure that allows King room for biting guitar work.  'Rock Me Baby' was released as a single on Kent in the spring of 1964 and climbed into the Top 20 of the R&B charts and the Top 40 of the pop charts, making it King's biggest crossover hit yet and his most successful pop record until the appearance of 'The Thrill Is Gone' five and a half years later.  That exposure helped the song become a blues standard, one that was played by many guitarists.  Probably the most radical restatement of 'Rock Me Baby' occurred on June 18, 1967, when the Jimi Hendrix Experience played it at the Monterey International Pop Festival.",Tell me about some of the wonders in Asia,train

According to historical records, the builders of the Great Wall were comprised of three groups: namely soldiers, peasants and convicted criminals.  Nearly 300,000 soldiers were summoned by the first emperor of Qin as a major labor force to take part in the construction.

Both the art and architecture from the Islamic world feature vibrant colours and intricate, geometric patterns; much like the kaleidoscopic patterns one can see during a psychedelic experience, either with eyes opened or closed.  During psychedelic experiences, people may report seeing arabesques, which are a fundamental aspect of Islamic art and consist of rhythmic linear patterns of interlacing foliage and spiralling stems.  An arabesque is usually a single design – featuring plant motifs – that is tessellated (or tiled).  Tessellation is when a surface is covered with geometric shapes that fit together in a pattern with no overlaps or gaps.  Some users of DMT have said that the ceilings of world-renowned mosques (such as the Jalil Khayat Mosque in Iraq) bear a striking resemblance to their DMT visions.

Ancient Rocks of Grand Canyon Most rocks in Grand Canyon are sedimentary rocks, which form when sediments such as sand, silt, or mud gather in thick layers that, over time, are compressed into rock.  Grand Canyon’s sedimentary rock layers accumulated over millions of years on the prehistoric surface of northern Arizona, which has been home to giant sand dunes, muddy river deltas, and shallow tropical seas over the past 500 million years.  These environments formed as ancient continents drifted across the globe and ancient oceans advanced and retreated over those continents.  Eventually, eroded sediments from each of these environments formed distinct layers of sedimentary rocks.  Sand dunes were cemented into sandstone, mud was compressed into shale, and the discarded shells of marine animals were cemented together into limestone.  Because Grand Canyon’s rocks were laid down chronologically, one on top of another, they reflect a geological relationship known as superposition.

Rice is by far one of the most popular staple food among Nigerians.  Almost every family eats rice daily in Nigeria.  In 2011 alone, Nigeria spent N991billion on rice importation and the rice we import is said to be nothing less than 10 years old in storage.  That means we spent billions buying rice that has since lost its nutritional values.  Any entrepreneur who goes into rice farming and get it right is sure to be smiling to the bank.  A bag of rice is currently sold for N13,000 to N16,000 depending on the quality.  A farmer who is able to invest in large scale rice production in Nigeria and able to produce 100,000 Bags of processed Rice in a year, sell at wholesale price of about N10,000 per bag, he will be making 10,000 x 100,000 = N1,000,000,000 ($3million)  You can achieve the above figures conveniently with less than five hundred and fifty million Naira ($1.5 Million) capital investment.",Wow.

A 20% down payment is viewed as ideal by lenders because you are investing a significant amount of your own money in your home and therefore the lender’s risk is reduced.  If you make a 20% down payment, you won’t have to pay private mortgage insurance.  PMI provides insurance to the lender in case you default on your loan.  Advantages of a 20% down payment for buyers In addition to eliminating the need for PMI, a 20% down payment on a house will qualify you for a slightly lower interest rate than a borrower who makes a smaller down payment.  Another benefit is that you will borrow less money, making your monthly payments smaller.  In addition, you will instantly have 20% equity in your home, which you can borrow against in the future or get back as part of your profit when you sell.

Still, there are loan programs that let borrowers make a smaller down payment without incurring PMI, but if you’re going with a conventional loan, 20% is usually ideal.  Evaluate your budget Lenders want reassurance that you’ll be able to make your mortgage payments on time in addition to all of your other financial obligations.  To do this, they determine your debt-to-income ratio.  First, they’ll look at your front-end ratio — your monthly housing payment (including insurance, interest, taxes, and PMI, if applicable) divided by your monthly income.  The general rule of thumb is to keep this at or below 28%.

The pawn shop will lend an amount equal to a percentage of the item’s value.  Payback windows are short — usually between 30 and 90 days — to pay it back with (oftentimes breathtaking) interest.  Most states have statutes limiting pawnbroker interest rates, although they can range as high as 120% APR.  There are additional problems with add-on fees for service, storage and a lost ticket.  Add-on fees can be more than what you paid in interest charges.  Regardless of any loan, consumers should read the entire agreement, especially the fine print.

Well, the easiest choice is to put it in a bank’s savings account.  A savings account is highly liquid — meaning you can withdraw your money anytime you want.  It is also safe because deposits up to P250,000 are covered by the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation.  If you want higher interest rate than a savings account, you may opt for a time deposit.  Here you park your money for a certain period of time and, in return, the bank offers you an interest rate relatively higher than what your regular savings account will get.  Like a savings account, time deposits are covered by the PDIC up to P250,000 per depositor.  Now, what if you still want a higher interest rate but are not willing to take additional risk?

So, this article takes a serious look at the concern by comparing and contrasting Bitcoin to systems that have Ponzi-like characteristics, to see if the claim holds up.

Initially a promising young actress, Spitzeder became a well-known private banker in 19th-century Munich when her theatrical success dwindled.  Running what was possibly the first recorded Ponzi scheme, she offered large returns on investments by continually using the money of new investors to pay back the previous ones.

The following are the most prevalent types of securities and commodities fraud schemes: Investment fraud: These schemes—sometimes referred to as “high-yield investment fraud”—involve the illegal sale or purported sale of financial instruments.  The typical investment fraud schemes are characterized by offers of low- or no-risk investments, guaranteed returns, overly-consistent returns, complex strategies, or unregistered securities.  These schemes often seek to victimize affinity groups—such as groups with a common religion or ethnicity—to utilize the common interests to build trust to effectively operate the investment fraud against them.  The perpetrators range from professional investment advisers to persons trusted and interacted with daily, such as a neighbor or sports coach.  The fraudster’s ability to foster trust makes these schemes so successful.  Investors should use scrutiny and gather as much information as possible before entering into any new investment opportunities.

According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), many Ponzi schemes share similar characteristics that should be 'red flags' for investors.  The warning signs include:  BULLET::::- High investment returns with little or no risk.  Every investment carries some degree of risk, and investments yielding higher returns typically involve more risk.  Any 'guaranteed' investment opportunity is often considered suspicious.   BULLET::::- Overly consistent returns.  Investment values tend to go up and down over time, especially those offering potentially high returns.  An investment that continues to generate regular positive returns regardless of overall market conditions is considered suspicious.   BULLET::::- Unregistered investments.  Ponzi schemes typically involve investments that have not been registered with the SEC or with state regulators.  Registration is important because it provides investors with access to key information about the company's management, products, services, and finances.   BULLET::::- Unlicensed sellers.

In particular, they describe a sustainability problem that they say happens when the number of new contributors declines.  William G. Shipman of the Cato Institute argues: In common usage a trust fund is an estate of money and securities held in trust for its beneficiaries.  The Social Security Trust Fund is quite different.  It is an accounting of the difference between tax and benefit flows.  When taxes exceed benefits, the federal government lends itself the excess in return for an interest-paying bond, an IOU that it issues to itself.  The government then spends its new funds on unrelated projects such as bridge repairs, defense, or food stamps.  The funds are not invested for the benefit of present or future retirees.  This criticism is not new.  In his 1936 presidential campaign, Republican Alf Landon called the trust fund 'a cruel hoax'.",What other similar schemes to Ponzi are there?,train

It is based on a fake investment that one schemer (or group of schemers) gets other people to give money to.  In Ponzi schemes, the schemer basically says, 'I found a great way to make money fast.  The more you give me, the more I can invest in that cause, and the more I can earn for us all'.  But a Ponzi scheme doesn't actually 'earn money'.  Instead, all of the scheme's money comes from the investors.  Once a Ponzi scheme gets too many investors, the system will always crash.  This is because the investors all expect more money than they invested, and they will get impatient.  These schemes always stop one of three ways: The schemer runs away with the money they got.  This is what schemers try to do.  The schemer runs out of money; They will be unable to promise money back right away.  This is called liquidity, and makes investors panic and demand their money back, often all at once.",What other similar schemes to Ponzi are there?,train

By 5 December 1492, Columbus had arrived at western Hispaniola, where he founded the colony of La Navidad and became its first viceroy.  Then he sailed to eastern Cuba.

23787,142_3-5,0,KILT_30864554-22,0,"The social aspects of clothing have revolved around traditions regarding certain items of clothing intrinsically suited different gender roles. In different periods, both women's and men's fashions have highlighted one area or another of the body for attention.  In particular, the wearing of skirts and trousers has given rise to common phrases expressing implied restrictions in use and disapproval of offending behavior.  For example, ancient Greeks often considered the wearing of trousers by Persian men as a sign of an effeminate attitude.  Women's clothing in Victorian fashion was used as a means of control and admiration.  Reactions to the elaborate confections of French fashion led to various calls for reform on the grounds of both beauties (Artistic and Aesthetic dress) and health (dress reform; especially for undergarments and lingerie).  Although trousers for women did not become fashionable until the later 20th century, women began wearing men's trousers (suitably altered) for outdoor work a hundred years earlier.  In the 1960s, André Courrèges introduced long trousers for women as a fashion item, leading to the era of the pantsuit and designer jeans, and the gradual eroding of the prohibitions against girls and women wearing trousers in schools, the workplace, and fine restaurants.  Corsets have long been used for fashion, and body modification, such as waistline reduction.","Thanks, but I’m not asking about clothing. Why is tango important to the history of Argentina?",train

One reason that dress is important for men is that it projects social status; women who reject a man in a Burger King uniform might be willing to date someone in medical scrubs.  The quality of non-work clothing also conveys an impression about where a person shops and their disposable income.  Women are attracted to other signs of high social status, from elite diction to driving an expensive car, or dining at a posh restaurant (3).  Perhaps, for this reason, many still prefer if the man pays the expenses of a date.  In our society, this is a sign of having disposable income and being generous enough to dispose of it.  Even in societies that did not use money, men were expected to bring gifts when they courted.  This practice bears analogy with the nuptial gifts of birds and insects where the female is lulled into a sense of security by getting a morsel to eat.  The act of generosity is invariably by the male.  This fits in with Bateman's Principle according to which males are more eager to mate and therefore must do something to win over the female.","Thanks, but I’m not asking about clothing.

While it’s true (and unfortunate) that women have to be more careful, Argentina is a great place for solo female travellers.  There are a number of dangers and annoyances that women will need to be aware of in Argentina, but these can be avoided with certain precautions.  Here are some key ones: Like most South American countries, Argentina is home to a macho society.  This means catcalling, regularly and frequently from almost all men.  If you’re walking alone this is likely to occur.  Ignore it, and it will become background noise.  If you feel uncomfortable in a situation, feel that you’re in danger, or feel threatened by someone, move towards a public place, a shop, tourist police – find help.  Don’t walk around sketchy streets after dark e.g. parks, shortcuts down alleyways, all the usual stuff.  Just be careful and think, “Would I walk through a place like this at home?”  If in doubt get an Uber home.  Often the safer option.  Taxis aren’t always great for solo women travellers, in both Argentina and the whole world for that matter.","Mmm, meat sweats.

Section::::History.:Pre-Columbian Patagonia (10,000 BC – 1520 AD).   Human habitation of the region dates back thousands of years, with some early archaeological findings in the area dated to at least the 13th millennium BC, although later dates around the 10th millennium BC are more securely recognized.  Evidence exists of human activity at Monte Verde in Llanquihue Province, Chile, dated to around 12,500 BC.  The glacial-period ice fields and subsequent large meltwater streams would have made settlement difficult at that time.   The region seems to have been inhabited continuously since 10,000 BC, by various cultures and alternating waves of migration, the details of which are as yet poorly understood.  Several sites have been excavated, notably caves such as Cueva del Milodon in Última Esperanza in southern Patagonia, and Tres Arroyos on Tierra del Fuego, that support this date.  Hearths, stone scrapers, animal remains dated to 9400–9200 BC have been found east of the Andes.   The Cueva de las Manos is a famous site in Santa Cruz, Argentina.

The Office for National Statistics explain this as follows:  This self-defined categorisation was also used for classifying ethnicity in the 2001 UK Census.  Slightly different categories were employed in Scotland and Northern Ireland, as compared with England and Wales, 'to reflect local differences in the requirement for information'.

Nevertheless, there was also a migratory flow of German, Swiss, and Middle-Eastern immigrants arriving in Argentina.  Among the countless changes this melting pot brought was the enrichment of culinary art.  Dishes such as pasta, pizza, pucheros ( stews ), croquetas ( fritters ), sauces, embutidos ( sausages ), and chicken and meat courses brought a wider scope of options to daily menus.

Argentineans love beef.  In fact in Buenos Aires many locals eat beef a dozen times a week.  So great is their respect for this noble meat that no Argentinean would ever dream of marinating it or of seasoning it with anything other than salt.  Still, two condiments are commonly served with grilled meats: a gusty parsley-garlic sauce called chimichurri and a robust relish called salsa criolla.  The former is a cross between pesto and vinaigrette, made with fragrant fresh flat-leaf parsley and a nose-blasting dose of garlic.  (Don't worry about bad breath: the parsley acts as a breath freshener.)  Salsa criolla combines tomatoes, onions and peppers.As in North America, a typical Argentinean steak house would serve baked potatoes or french fries.

Waterfalls were first recorded by a Spanish conquistador Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca in 1541.  Today the falls are a UNESCO heritage.

After The Great French Wine Blight, many vines were left devastated; the remaining crops took a another large hit during the 1950’s when a heavy frost killed nearly ¾’s of the Malbec crop in France, which led to a decrease in the grapes use and popularity in France.  The vine rootstocks were transported to New World regions like Argentina in an effort to invigorate the vine's production.  Wines made with Malbec grapes are balanced, smooth and very drinkable with a well-rounded mouthfeel.  The Malbec grape develops widely different flavors depending on where it is grown; when grown in France it has pronounced leathery flavors and flavors of currant, black plum and can be quite bitter, while Malbec grapes grown in Argentina have pronounced fruit flavors of plum, cherry and blackberry, chocolate, floral and hints of leather.

Opening a euro-denominated bank account is essential if you travel or work in Europe.  The European Union has 27 member countries, of which 16 have adopted the euro as their currency.  You benefit from being able to use your credit and debit cards in any of the 16 countries without concerns about exchange rates and associated charges.  ATM withdrawals are usually free.  The euro is also widely accepted in European countries that haven't adopted the euro.  U.S. citizens can open a euro bank account as the U.S. government doesn't impose restrictions.  However, the Internal Revenue Service does require you to declare assets in a euro bank account if the amount deposited exceeds the currency equivalent of $10,000.  You should also declare dividend and interest payments credited to your euro account.  Step 1 Choose one of the 16 European countries to open a euro bank account (see Resources).  Select one of the major countries; it is likely to have a branch in the U.S. It makes it easier to open and manage your euro bank account.","Awesome, good to know.

The EBF is an obvious dialogue partner for the European institutions in laying out this legislation.   Furthermore, the role of the Federation as the united voice of all EU banks has naturally led it to be a forum where members' initiatives are proposed and debated.

The US Federal Reserve has been conducting open market operations since the 1920s through the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The European Central Bank (ECB) says that the Eurosystem’s regular open market operations consist of: – Main Refinancing Operations: also known as MROs.  These are one-week liquidity-providing operations in euros.  They serve to steer interest rates over the short term, to signal the monetary policy stance in the euro zone, and to manage the liquidity situation.  – Longer-Term Refinancing Operations: also known as LTROs.  These are three-month liquidity-providing operations in euros.  They serve to provide additional financing to the financial sector over the long term.

The Michigan Act (1837) allowed the automatic chartering of banks that would fulfill its requirements without special consent of the state legislature.  This legislation made creating unstable banks easier by lowering state supervision in states that adopted it.  The real value of a bank bill was often lower than its face value, and the issuing bank's financial strength generally determined the size of the discount.

Open banking APIs accelerate innovation and collaboration, leading to expanded banking ecosystems that could include more than just financial services to make a consumer’s lifestyle better.  What is exciting about open banking is that making consumer consent a central part of open banking strategy places an increased emphasis on consumer value propositions.  In other words, if improved value isn’t part of the open banking consumer proposition, the customer will not allow the sharing of their data.

Application Programming Interface management, or API management, consists of a set of tools and services that enable developers and companies to build, analyze, operate, and scale APIs in secure environments.  API management can be delivered on-premises, through the cloud, or using a hybrid on-premises – SaaS (Software as a Service) approach.  At their simplest level, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) enable communication between disparate software applications.  Developers can connect APIs from different companies and services to achieve specific results.  Popular API uses include enabling the implementation of libraries and frameworks across languages, specifying the interface between an application and an operating system, manipulating remote resources through protocols, and defining the interface through which interactions happen between a third-party and the applications that use its assets.  From independent mobile developers and web developers to large enterprises and governmental agencies, APIs are increasingly leveraged across industries and use cases.  Today, developers, enterprises, and organizations often create open APIs that allow others to integrate with their products and services.","Wow, that’s amazing!

The banking relationship will allow the exchanges’ crypto customers to complete withdrawals, wire transfers and deposits to and from Coinbase and Gemini, establishing a critical bridge for the digital asset ecosystem.  Although Bitcoin is censorship-resistant and is not controlled by governments, central banks or central authorities, the network needs participation from major financial institutions in order to reach mass adoption.  Without bridges in place that allow customers to link their bank accounts to a cryptocurrency exchange, enabling smooth and rapid transfers, the reach of digital assets could remain limited in scope.  Both Coinbase and Gemini have focused on developing strong regulatory frameworks that ultimately allowed them to pass a strict vetting process on the road to approval by the banking giant.  The JPMorgan Chase turning point, at least at the outset, lessens the argument that Bitcoin will effectively be stamped out by choking off crucial access points: primarily traditional banks that allow dollars to be converted into BTC and other cryptocurrencies.

A Liquid rocket engine can also usually be reused for several flights, as in the Space Shuttle and Falcon 9 series rockets, although reuse of solid rocket motors was also effectively demonstrated during the shuttle program.  Bipropellant liquid rockets are simple in concept but due to high temperatures and high speed moving parts, very complex in practice.  Use of liquid propellants can be associated with a number of issues: Because the propellant is a very large proportion of the mass of the vehicle, the center of mass shifts significantly rearward as the propellant is used; one will typically lose control of the vehicle if its center mass gets too close to the center of drag/pressure.",When did people first start caring about rocket engine reusability?,train

The idea of maternal care was developed during the 1950s, starting from two different, if overlapping, areas.  The first was a concern with the fact that the mother's extended absence — the effective loss of the mother — could lead to a depressive response on the part of the child (Spitz, 1946), to anxiety reactions, or to developmental delays.

The company SpaceX is developing the technologies over a number of years to facilitate full and rapid reusability of space launch vehicles.  The project's long-term objectives include returning a launch vehicle first stage to the launch site in minutes and to return a second stage to the launch pad following orbital realignment with the launch site and atmospheric reentry in up to 24 hours.  SpaceX's long term goal is that both stages of their orbital launch vehicle will be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return.   The program was publicly announced in 2011.  SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015.  The first re-flight of a landed first stage occurred in March 2017 with the second occurring in June 2017, that one only five months after the maiden flight of the booster.  The third attempt occurred in October 2017 with the SES-11/EchoStar-105 mission.  Second flights of refurbished first stages then became routine.

Rocket engines The biggest (and arguably the most interesting) part of a rocket is the propulsion system—the engine that powers it into the sky.  As we've already seen, rockets differ from jet planes (and other fuel-powered vehicles that work on Earth) because they have to carry their own oxygen supply.  Modern space rockets have main engines powered by a liquid fuel (such as liquid hydrogen) and liquid oxygen (which does the same job as the air sucked into a car engine) that are pumped in from huge tanks.  The fuel (also called the propellant) and oxygen  (called the oxidizer) are stored at low temperatures and high pressures so more can be carried in tanks of a certain size, which means the rocket can go further on the same volume of fuel.  External rocket boosters that assist a main rocket engine typically burn solid fuel instead  (the Space Shuttle's were called solid rocket boosters, or SRBs, for exactly that reason).",Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?,train

Hydrogen internal combustion engine development has been receiving more interest recently, particularly for heavy duty commercial vehicles.  Part of the motivation for this is as a bridging technology to meet future climate CO2 emission goals, and as technology more compatible with existing automotive knowledge and manufacturing.  Efficiency Since hydrogen internal combustion engines are heat engines, their maximum efficiency is limited by the Carnot efficiency.  In comparison, the efficiency of a fuel cell is limited by the Gibbs free energy, which is typically higher than that of Carnot.  Hydrogen combustion engines are particularly sensitive to transients in load, in terms of efficiency, and therefore more suited to constant load operations.

In a solid rocket, the fuel and oxidizer are mixed together into a solid propellant which is packed into a solid cylinder.  A hole through the cylinder serves as a combustion chamber .  When the mixture is ignited, combustion takes place on the surface of the propellant.  A flame front is generated which burns into the mixture.  The combustion produces great amounts of exhaust gas at high temperature and pressure .  The amount of exhaust gas that is produced depends on the area of the flame front and engine designers use a variety of hole shapes to control the change in thrust for a particular engine.  The hot exhaust gas is passed through a nozzle which accelerates the flow.  Thrust is then produced according to Newton's third law of motion.

Newton's third law of motion says that the action of the hot gases produces a reaction in the opposite direction on the jet or rocket propelled vehicle; the momentum imparted to the gases is exactly opposite to the momentum imparted to the vehicle.  The main difference between the two types of engine is that a rocket carries its own supply of oxygen for combustion.

His third law states that for every action (force) in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction.  In other words, if object A exerts a force on object B, then object B also exerts an equal and opposite force on object A. Notice that the forces are exerted on different objects.  In aerospace engineering, the principal of action and reaction is very important.  Newton's third law explains the generation of thrust by a rocket engine.  In a rocket engine, hot exhaust gas is produced through the combustion of a fuel with an oxidizer.  The hot exhaust gas flows through the rocket nozzle and is accelerated to the rear of the rocket.  In re-action, a thrusting force is produced on the engine mount.  The thrust accelerates the rocket as described by Newton's second law of motion.

For a reusable Falcon 9, it is around Mach 6, depending on the mission.”  For their reusable rocket this means the lower and upper stage separation needs to happen earlier, which puts a lot of extra strain on the upper stage – this translates in less cargo handling capabilities since each stage needs more fuel, first to be able to fly back on their own to the launch side and second to compensate for the earlier separation.  Still, if you have enough of these rockets and launch them often enough, this will greatly compensate.

The LS1 engine is the newer design that replaced the older LT1 engines.  The main difference between the LS1 and LT1 engines is the material used in the block.  LT1 engines were made out of cast iron while the LS1 engine blocks were made out of aluminum, except those made for trucks, which are still made out of cast iron for optimal strength and durability.  The change in metal used has distinct effects on how the engines perform.  The LS1 engines are much lighter compared to the LT1 engines, and in vehicles, reducing the weight always relates to better performance.  The aluminum block of the LS1 engine is also much better in dissipating heat compared to the cast iron block of the LT1.  This lets the engine achieve a higher compression without worrying about overheating the engine due to excessive heat.  Because of this and a variety of other factors, the LS1 engines produce more power than LT1 engines.

Each builds a hard, protective external skeleton of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) around its base.  Thousands together make up a reef, with each polyp connected to the next by a thin layer of tissue.  Reefs grow when polyps periodically lift off their base and secrete a new one, adding layers of calcium.

This can happened naturally, by outside force, or for growing purposes.  The sexual part of the reproductive coral is naturally a bit more complicated as sexual reproduction is fundamentally more complex than asexual reproduction.  While each coral species is unique, the majority of stony coral species produce male and/or female gametes.  That’s right: some corals will produce both male and female gametes depending on conditions.  Most species of coral are broadcast spawners, meaning that each coral releases massive numbers of male (sperm) and female (egg) gametes into the water in order to distribute their offspring throughout the water.  As one can imagine, the timing of these mass spawning events must be timed perfectly and synchronized to be successful due to the stationary nature of mature corals.  The goal is for the egg and sperm from the individual corals to meet in the water, fusing to form free-floating or planktonic larvae.  These larvae are called planulae.

A sharp increase in water temperatures as seen in El Nino years can cause coral bleaching and eventual death to the coral.  Photo: Bleaching occurs when coral become stressed by heat, cold, chemicals, or other factors.  Photo courtesy of NOAA.  Some scientists believe that human actions are increasing greenhouse gases (gases like carbon dioxide that let in almost all the sun's radiation, but block much of the outgoing radiation from Earth).  They call this global warming.  They believe the Earth's atmosphere is getting warmer.  If true this could upset the delicate balance of temperatures that coral reefs need to thrive.  Coral reefs are important in determining the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  The zooxanthellae algae, through photosynthesis, remove carbon dioxide from the air and make carbohydrates available as food for both the zooxanthellae and the coral polyps.  Eventually, much of the carbon removed from the air will reside on the ocean bottom in the form of limestone produced by coral polyps.  However, both the coral polyps and the zooxanthellae must also use oxygen through the process of respiration (the same process humans use in breathing).  Respiration releases carbon dioxide into the ocean and atmosphere.",Do corals capture carbon?,train

The parasite benefits by gaining nutrients, but does so at the expense of the host because it now needs to eat more in order to survive.  Zooxanthellae are photosynthetic algae that live inside coral polyps.  Coral polyps and zooxanthellae have a mutalistic symbiotic relationship.  The calcium carbonate skeleton produced by the coral polyps provides the zooxanthellae with a protected environment suitable for photosynthesis.  In return, the photosynthetic algae produce oxygen and aid the coral in removing waste.  Additionally, zooxanthellae provide the coral with nutrients such as glucose, glyserol, and amino acids, which are products of photosynthesis.  These compounds are utilized by the coral as building blocks in the manufacture of fats, as well as the synthesis of their calcium carbonate skeleton.  Some polyps are able to capture enough nutrients to survive without zooxanthellae, but these are rare.  It has been found that zooxanthellae donate up to ninety percent of the organic material produced during photosynthesis to the host coral tissue.  When coral polyps become stressed due to a change in the environment, often caused by human activity, they can lose the zooxanthellae.",Do corals capture carbon?,train

Coral also lives alongside algae, but if there are too many algae then they compete with corals for space.  This happens because climate change has given the algae an advantage over coral reefs.  It turns out that algae were not the only problem, as they also caused a change in the coral’s microbiome.  The high amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released by the algae allowed for an explosion of microbes and depleted all of the oxygen in the area.  The corals became unable to get any oxygen because their own microbes ate it up.  It was not a new pathogen that posed problems; instead, it was just an overgrowth of existing bacteria within these corals.  It is clear from this study that human activity has impacted how corals interact with their microbiomes.  Microbes play an important role in our health.  In fact, they help determine whether we are healthy or not.  They’re meant to live in harmony with each other.  When that harmony is disturbed, the microbes can change and cause disease.

Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide further threaten the corals in other ways; as CO 2 dissolves in ocean waters, it lowers the pH and increases ocean acidity.  As acidity increases, it interferes with the calcification that normally occurs as coral animals build their calcium carbonate homes.  When a coral reef begins to die, species diversity plummets as animals lose food and shelter.  Coral reefs are also economically important tourist destinations, so the decline of coral reefs poses a serious threat to coastal economies.  Human population growth has damaged corals in other ways, too.  As human coastal populations increase, the runoff of sediment and agricultural chemicals has increased, too, causing some of the once-clear tropical waters to become cloudy.  At the same time, overfishing of popular fish species has allowed the predator species that eat corals to go unchecked.

Essentially, not all of the carbon dioxide that mankind emits remains in the atmosphere.  In fact, a fairly large portion enters the ocean, and this reduces its pH, which increases its acidity as a result.  Will Cause Coral Bleaching Consequently, ocean acidification may cause a reduction in the calcification rates of calcifying organisms.  These include corals, mollusks, algae and crustaceans.  By reducing the calcification rates of corals, ocean acidification will, in turn, cause coral bleaching.  Ocean Acidification and Climate Change Although climate change and ocean acidification are two very different environmental issues, they share the same cause: carbon dioxide emissions.  In essence, by reducing our emissions of carbon dioxide, we will not only mitigate climate change, but we will also help stop ocean acidification.  Although ocean acidification may sound like a trivial issue, it is not.

34717,146_1-1,0,MARCO_34_853427208-1,0,"Packing tips and packing list | Planning for your bike tour - BikeTours.com Packing for a bike tour Rule #1: PACK LIGHT.  Try to limit yourself to a carry-on bag.  This isn’t a requirement, just a suggestion.  (The extra airline fees are just the beginning of the trouble with extra or heavy bags—train stations and hotels don’t always have elevators!)  It’s tough but doable, especially if you plan ahead.  If you’re not sure if your suitcase is too heavy, carry it a couple of blocks at a fast clip, or up a flight of stairs without stopping.  If you’re uncomfortable, it’s too heavy.  (We recommend this activity for pre-dawn, before the neighbors wake up and wonder if you’ve finally gone over the edge.)  On most bicycle tours, you’re on the move with little time for laundry and drying.  When possible, travel with fast-drying clothing – from undergarments to outerwear.  Check out our clothing recommendations.  Synthetic fabrics/blends are not only the most breathable and quick drying, they can also be the easiest to pack (the worst fabric to ride in is cotton).",What's the difference between bike packing and bike touring?,train

The company offers a two-year limited warranty against defects in craftsmanship.  Flaws but not dealbreakers: The rain flaps that cover the zippers are very stiff, almost to a point of frustration.  We were often left wrestling with zippers caught at weird angles.  That said, we don’t think that’s a good enough reason not to buy this bag if you like everything else about it.

View at REI THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN BUYING BIKEPACKING BAGS STYLE There are seven main styles of bikepacking bags listed above: Trunk Bag These sit on top of a rear rack and are one of the larger bags used when bikepacking.  Pannier These are used in a pair for even weight distribution and are typically attached to a rear or front rack.  Panniers will often boast the largest carrying capacity of all the bags available for bikepacking.  Seat-Pack or Saddle-Bag These attach to your seat and seat post and come in a variety of sizes.  They are often used for lightweight touring and bikepacking.  Frame Bag These sit in the middle triangle of your bike frame and will either take up the entire area (full frame bag) or part of the area (half frame bag).  Frame bags are great for storing heavier items as they help keep the center of gravity low when riding.  Top Tube Bag These are small bags that sit on the top tube of your bike.  Top tube bags are commonly used for storing valuables and ride nutrition and they provide easy access while riding.,Can any bike be used for bike packing?,train

The MTB-specific Shimano Steps E7000 motor is really responsive to pedalling input and only really needs to be used in full power on the steepest of climbs.  I’m really impressed with the new Merida eSilex +600 – it’s ready for a spot of bike packing, all you need to do is add bags.  The fact that it’s so light and has all those mounting points make it viable for touring / bike packing.  The battery range will depend on how much you rely on the e-assist – I would recommend riding it like a regular bike and use the electric to help you with steep climbs.  Another absolute corker of a bike is the BMC Alpenchallenge AMP Sport Three DB – with a fully carbon frame and Micro Travel system in the rear, it really does take the sting out of rough terrain.

All their stock will be sent in BIG cardboard boxes and they usually have some of these in stock.  Get one that's big enough and one that has handles if possible.

This comes in various thickness and you may be lucky with off cuts from a DIY store, alternatively use the mountains of bubble wrap you have after buying stuff from Scan!  Select first on the bike (big cog at the back) - this makes the rear mech not stick out.  If you can take the pedals off then this really helps.  Put the pipes around all of the main tubes and the rear seat stays.  Next, take off the front wheel and the seat post/seat.

You can find titanium touring bikes too, which are notably expensive, but they’re tough and light, and the vibration damping can be a godsend on rough roads and dirt.  Touring Bike Geometry There are a handful of subtle differences within touring bike geometries that set them apart from road bikes.  Touring geometry is more upright, creating a riding position that’s more comfortable during long hours in the saddle.  You’ll see different bike companies refer to this as their “endurance” or “adventure” geometry.  This “endurance” geometry plays out in a handful of different ways.  The wheelbase and chainstay of a classic touring bike is typically longer to make room for rear racks and panniers, and the bottom bracket is typically lower to increase stability.  The head tube is typically longer on a touring bike, essentially elevating the handlebar, and there’s more slack, helping to extend the wheelbase.  Touring bikes also generally have a shorter top tube, or more important, a shorter “reach,” which is the distance from the center of the bottom bracket to the top of the head tube.","OK, and what can I do to make my bike more comfortable?",train

If this isn’t enough for you, consider checking out adjustable levers – a very common modification on sport bikes – that can extend or retract the lever to where it’s most comfortable for you.  Adjusting Your Clip-on Handlebars Some sport bikes allow you to rotate the clip-on bars to be closer in or wider out.  Just as with the levers, simply loosen the pinch bolts and rotate them in or out while sitting on the bike to a position that is more comfortable for you, then tighten them back up.  Tip: there are typically two pinch bolts holding clip-ons onto the fork leg – when tightening them, make sure to do them evenly, alternating with half-turns on each until they are both tight.  Check torque specs and use a torque wrench if you can – pinch bolts are usually not torqued very hard.  Adjusting Your Shifter Peg /Brake Everyone’s foot size is different, so where the shifter and brake pegs fall on your bike may not be where it’s most comfortable for you.

Cruisers If you’re looking for a comfortable bike with a classic look, consider a cruiser.  The bicycle standard from the 1930s through 1950s, cruisers feature wide tires and padded seats for a more comfortable riding experience.  Curved, upright handlebars put the rider in a better position to view the world around them.  Cruisers typically have heavier frames, but some newer models use lightweight aluminum frames.  The traditional cruiser has just one gear, but more modern cruisers come with three to seven speeds.  Also called beach bikes or boulevardiers, these classic bikes work best on flat terrain.  Utility/Cargo Bikes Perfect for hauling groceries, camping gear, and other items—utility and cargo bikes feature a sturdy, elongated frame with heavy-duty storage racks over the rear tires.  A variety of accessories can be hooked onto the rear rack, such as baskets, child seats, and panniers to hold your gear.  The upright seating position gives you a good view of the road, the rims have extra spokes for additional strength, and the wider tires offer a more stable ride.

Mountain bikes generally feature a 'straight handlebar' or 'riser bar' with varying degrees of sweep backwards and centimeters rise upwards, as well as wider widths which can provide better handling due to increased leverage against the wheel.  Seating A Selle San Marco saddle designed for women Saddles also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more room for leg swings.  Comfort depends on riding position.  With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable.  For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient.  Differing saddle designs exist for male and female cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men.",What’s the best bike seat,train

Perhaps most importantly, The Avengers hinges on Loki's efforts to steal the Tesseract and acquire it for Thanos.  That story finally came full circle in Infinity War.  See it on Amazon 3.  Thor: The Dark World While not generally regarded as one of the better MCU movies, Thor: The Dark World makes one important contribution by introducing another Infinity Stone, the Reality Stone, found in the destructive weapon known as the Aether.  This film also sets the stage for the downfall of Asgard in later MCU movies, ending with Odin being betrayed and replaced by his adopted son, Loki.

There is nothing in the Scriptures to indicate that people are excluded from God’s saving grace on the basis of ethnic origin or skin color.  God is “not wanting anyone to perish” (2 Peter 3:9).  Jesus is the Savior of all peoples.  Nevertheless, it is a fact that the majority of European artists and Bible commentators painted and described all biblical characters, including God, as white.  This had the effect of excluding blacks from being a part of Scripture and has led some people of color to question the Bible’s relevance to them.  Exclusion was only one side of the problem.

In recent months, the company has become a go-to example of the lack of diversity in the technology industry.  Sixty percent of the company's employees are white; that jumps to 72 percent when looking at leadership roles.  Overall, fewer than 2 percent of Twitter's employees are black, and none are in leadership roles.  While it's true that many major tech companies have similar diversity statistics, but Twitter's numbers stand out because so many of its users are black.   And the disparity between the company and its users has not gone unnoticed.  To address some of those issues, Twitter announced that it has hired a new vice president for diversity and inclusion, Jeffery Siminoff.  The fifty-year-old replaces Janet Van Huysse, and comes from a similar role at Apple.  He is known for his extensive work with Out Leadership -- a group dedicated to demonstrating how equality in general makes for good business, with a particular focus on LGBT executives.   He was also named in a TechCrunch piece identifying '10 Men Making Waves for Women in Tech.'",Interesting.

What is Diode Clipper?  Diode is a device which allows current to flow in only one direction.  For that purpose, we have seen that diodes are used as rectifiers.  But diode is not restricted to only this application in this article we will learn about another amazing application of Diode as a Limiters or mostly known as Clippers.  A clipper (or limiter) is used to clip off or cut off the portion of applied voltage (A.C) either in Positive direction or Negative direction.

The percent using decentralized search engines is likely even less than that.  However, because they are so new, data for this is actually hard to find.  If decentralized search engines become more popular, there is actually a chance that there may be an increasing fusion between decentralized search engines and cryptocurrencies.  This is because such search engines can make it easier to identify decentralized apps (Dapps) and other programs or companies which use blockchain technology.  For example, one search engine, called Weipoint, was just launched by a former Coinbase engineer named Antonio Juliano.  This search engine makes it easy for searchers to find Dapps that use ethereum-based smart contracts and that run on a blockchain.  This search engine could be the first of many that are based around cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.  Challenges for Decentralized Search Engines For starters, if decentralized search engines get large enough, then it is possible that the main centralized search engine companies could view them as a threat and start to try to compete with them more.

For example, in late June 2019, YouTube removed a video created by Project Veritas (Lean Right media bias rating), a nonprofit founded by conservative James O’Keefe that is dedicated to exposing corruption.  The video showed undercover footage of Google executive Jen Gennai discussing the tech giant’s search algorithm.

40752,149_2-7,0,MARCO_16_1883837804-6,0,"Some algorithms collect their own data based on human-selected criteria, which can also reflect the bias of human designers. Other algorithms may reinforce stereotypes and preferences as they process and display 'relevant' data for human users, for example, by selecting information based on previous choices of a similar user or group of users.  Beyond assembling and processing data, bias can emerge as a result of design.  For example, algorithms that determine the allocation of resources or scrutiny (such as determining school placements) may inadvertently discriminate against a category when determining risk based on similar users (as in credit scores).  Meanwhile, recommendation engines that work by associating users with similar users, or that make use of inferred marketing traits, might rely on inaccurate associations that reflect broad ethnic, gender, socio-economic, or racial stereotypes.  Another example comes from determining criteria for what is included and excluded from results.  This criteria could present unanticipated outcomes for search results, such as with flight-recommendation software that omits flights that do not follow the sponsoring airline's flight paths.  Algorithms may also display an uncertainty bias, offering more confident assessments when larger data sets are available.  This can skew algorithmic processes toward results that more closely correspond with larger samples, which may disregard data from underrepresented populations.","In terms of their ranking though, how do search engines rank items?",train

Since objectivity is key to using these assessments, a good psychometric test provides fair and accurate results each time it's given.  To ensure this, the test must meet these three key criteria: Standardization – The test must be based on results from a sample population that's truly representative of the people who'll be taking the test.  You can't realistically test every working person in a country.  But you can test a representative sample of that group, and then apply the results to the specific people whom you test.  Also, a standardized test is administered the same way every time to help reduce any test bias.

41186,149_3-3,0,KILT_1398166-1,0,"Net neutrality  Network neutrality, or simply net neutrality, is the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) must treat all Internet communications equally, and not discriminate or charge differently based on user, content, website, platform, application, type of equipment, or method of communication.   With net neutrality, ISPs may not intentionally block, slow down, or charge money for specific online content.  Without net neutrality, ISPs may prioritize certain types of traffic, meter others, or potentially block traffic from specific services, while charging consumers for various tiers of service.   The term was coined by Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu in 2003, as an extension of the longstanding concept of a common carrier, which was used to describe the role of telephone systems.  Net neutrality regulations may be referred to as 'common carrier' regulations.  Net neutrality does not block all abilities that Internet service providers have to impact their customers' services.  Opt-in/opt-out services exist on the end user side, and filtering can be done on a local basis, as in the filtration of sensitive material for minors.   Research suggests that a combination of policy instruments will help realize the range of valued political and economic objectives central to the network neutrality debate.","Um, what is search neutrality?",validation

Neutrality is not to be confused with neutralism, or nonalignment, under international law.  At the opening of hostilities, a nonbelligerent state generally issues a proclamation of neutrality.  It is then the duty of the neutral power to observe strict impartiality in its relations with the warring nations.  However, absolute neutrality is not always the reality, and the terms benevolent and hostile imply the sympathy of a neutral for one or other of the belligerents.  The duty of the belligerent is to respect neutral territory (land and air) and neutral territorial waters (see waters, territorial waters, territorial, all waters within the jurisdiction, recognized in international law, of a country.

However, it remains the least used among our yes alternatives.  And how!  If the aforementioned yes alternatives are too run-of-the-mill for your tastes, try and how!

41618,149_3-9,0,MARCO_00_1706923902-1,0,"What is Ecosocialism?  What is Ecosocialism?  Ecosocialism is a vision of a transformed society in harmony with nature, and the development of practices that can attain it.  It is directed toward alternatives to all socially and ecologically destructive systems, such as patriarchy, racism, homophobia and the fossil-fuel based economy.  It is based on a perspective that regards other species and natural ecosystems as valuable in themselves and as partners in a common destiny.  Ecosocialism shares with traditional socialism a passion for justice.  It shares the conviction that capitalism has been a deadly detour for humanity.  We understand capitalism to be a class society based on infinite expansion, through the exploitation of labor and the ransacking of nature.  Ecosocialists are also guided by the life-ways of indigenous peoples whose economies are embedded in a classless society in fundamental unity with nature.  We draw upon the wisdom of the ages as well as the latest science, and will do what can be done to bring a new society, beyond capitalism, into existence.  We recognize that ecosocialism on a global scale is a long way from being realized.  But it is on the horizon: far off, yet rising; indefinite yet vital, a terrain to be mapped, explored, and brought into existence.",I’ve never heard of the ecosia search engine.

41610,149_3-9,0,KILT_34440118-2,0,"ECO first grew out of discussions that took place in 2010 among pastors of the Presbyterian Church (USA) who were concerned about the denomination's declining membership and the theological disputes they believed were distractions from the church's primary calling to spread the gospel. PC(USA) had faced controversy for years over its liberal theology and disputes over the authority of the Bible.  In 2008, its General Assembly proposed allowing the ordination of partnered LGBT clergy.  This proposal was adopted in 2011, but it was opposed by evangelical Presbyterians.    In February 2011, a group of pastors issued a white paper that declared the PC(USA) 'deathly ill' and called for a new approach.  In August, the Fellowship of Presbyterians was formed as an umbrella organization of evangelicals in the Presbyterian Church (USA).  The Fellowship initiated plans for ECO in response to interest from pastors and congregations for a new Presbyterian denomination.  ECO was created to accommodate conservative Presbyterians that permitted the ordination of women.  While other conservative Presbyterian churches in the United States existed, most of these did not permit female clergy.   ECO was officially launched in January 2012 at a conference in Orlando, Florida.  It began accepting member congregations in April.  In the five years between 2012 and 2017, 303 former PC(USA) congregations joined ECO.   Section::::Beliefs.",I’ve never heard of the ecosia search engine. What does that do?,train
