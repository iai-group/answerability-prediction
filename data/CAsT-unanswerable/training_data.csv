for the vast majority of people with Parkinson's disease about eighty-five percent of people so it's a lot right but in a handful of people with Parkinson's disease about 15% we actually do know what caused the disease and for these people something's actually gone wrong with at least one of their genes so a quick recap on genes remember that genes are essentially specific segments of our DNA right so you'd find them in almost every cell in your body so there are specific segments of DNA that provide instructions to the cell and each gene is like a special recipe so each gene has instructions for how to make different proteins and once these proteins are made they go off and they do tons of different tasks tons of different important tasks all around our bodies like well basically everything basically everything is done by proteins from creating our cellular structure to our organs to our enzymes those are proteins to essentially every structure or process in our bodies that you can even think of absolutely everything somehow involves proteins so when something goes wrong with our genes let's say it's supposed to look like this right but maybe due to a mutation a change in that gene it ends up actually looking kind of different so maybe something like this here now all of a sudden the instructions the recipe that that gene has for making their proteins they're not correct anymore right they're not the same and so the proteins that should be made the proteins that we want these genes to make now they can't be made properly anymore at least in cells that have these genes that are affected that are changed that are mutated and when proteins are made properly well they won't be able to carry out their normal roles anymore right so we actually have a collection of genes a family of genes that when they're changed when they're mutated in some 'we can either directly cause or increase our chance of developing Parkinson's disease and this depends on on which gene gets mutated now remember how we get our DNA how we get our chromosomes so we have 23 single chromosomes that we get from our dad and we get another 23 single chromosomes from our mom and they form pairs so we end up with 23 pairs of chromosomes right so that means that we have two copies of each gene right one copy came from your mom and one copy came from your dad now let's actually classify genetic causes of Parkinson's disease into two groups so two types of inheritance if you will so we'll say autosomal dominant over here and and we'll say autosomal recessive over here on this side and this will all start to make sense in a minute here and the inheritance patterns can get really detailed and messy so I'm not going to really go into all of that at the moment but basically I want to get across here that the autosomal dominant types of Parkinson's disease or really any other disease that's inherited in an autosomal dominant way you only really need one bad copy of the gene so either one bad copy from your mom or one bad copy from your dad and that would be enough to cause the disease so in this case in our case that's Parkinson's disease and autosomal recessive well that means that both mom and dad need to pass on to you a mutated copy of the gene and there's one other thing I should mention so so when we say that a gene mutation causes a disease so in this case we say a gene mutation causes Parkinson's disease we can either mean that it definitely causes the disease 100% so if you get the mutated copy or if it needs two copies of the gene you will definitely develop the disease or we can mean that getting the mutated copy or copies will increase your chance of developing the disease so those two things are a little different right and for some genes certain mutations within that gene will definitely cause the disease and other mutations in that gene may just increase the chance of a disease developing and that's because different mutations in Jeane affect the genes protein in different ways right so some mutations may be more detrimental than others so that can increase the chance of disease developing so as we're chatting about these these mutated genes that we're going to get to that are relevant to Parkinson's disease we're just going to say that they can cause the disease but in the back of our minds we just have to remember that depending on which specific mutation in the gene is happening because there can be quite a few different ones in one gene and this is still being researched right the mutation can either 100% cause the disease or just increase the chances of developing the disease okay so there are five main genes that we know about so there are a few more but there's five main ones that when they're mutated in some way can cause Parkinson's disease so we won't go into all of these genes but let's go over a few of the genes that are a bit more commonly mutated so let's head over here to our first chromosome chromosome number one so here's our first chromosome so it's just it's just hanging out here and and right about here we have a gene called Park seven and park seven it has instructions for making a protein called DJ one so here's DJ one here and and DJ one kind of makes me think of a mom when I think about what DJ one does I think if I think of a mom it does things like protecting and guiding right protecting and guiding our molecules around our body you know like how your mom protects and guides you right so it helps protect ourselves it helps protect them during situations that stress ourselves out and and it helps guide our proteins so it helps guide them to do things like make sure they're folding in the correct three-dimensional shape because remember that our proteins are proteins need to get into a certain shape in order to be able to function properly right and dj1 also helps to make sure that damaged proteins proteins that we we don't want anymore are sent off to be broken down because otherwise they kind of pile up in our cells and they get in the way right now this last ones not very mom-like I'm sure none of our moms would send us off to be degraded but anyway so those are some of the main tasks of dj1 so some mutations in the gene park7 can cause Parkinson's disease park7 is one of those genes where you need to get a mutated copy from both your mom and your dad in order to develop Parkinson's disease so this would be considered an autosomal recessive cause of Parkinson's disease and it's actually responsible for early onset Parkinson's disease so so Parkinson's that's diagnosed before the age of 50 years old so when park7 is mutated when the genes DNA is changed in some way that changes the instructions on how to make the dj1 protein right because the gene carries our recipe for that protein so when this has changed dj1 isn't made properly and therefore it can't function properly it can't do all of these important mom-like tasks that we talked about so that's park7 and dj1 so what's our next gene let's let's jump over here to chromosome 6 and let's check out our next gene so about about here on chromosome 6 about here this is this is where our Park 2 gene is and for a mutation in this gene to cause Parkinson's disease it would need to be inherited in an autosomal recessive way as well a mutated copy from both your mom and your dad oh and something that's really interesting is that the park 2 gene it's one of the largest genes that we humans have in our whole body so it's one of the biggest genes that we have so park2 it encodes for a protein called Parkin so let's draw let's draw a little Park in protein here and Parkin has this really really important role what it does is it tags other proteins that are damaged or or that we have too many of there they're in excess and it tags them with this molecule called ubiquitin so ubiquitin is like a it's like a little flag it's a flag that alerts ourselves to shuttle these proteins that we don't want that we don't want anymore and it alerts them to shuttle them to these structures in our cells called proteasome and this is where those proteins that we don't want get broken down and disposed of so proteasomes are kind of like the the waste disposal facility in our cells so parking is really really important from making sure that we don't have all these excess or damaged proteins kind of piling up in ourselves and getting in the way so we actually know of a couple 100 different Park two mutations that can cause parkinson's disease so some of these mutations are associated with the juvenile form of Parkinson's disease which is essentially an extremely early onset type of Parkinson's disease relatively speaking to when it normally comes on so when people are diagnosed before the age of 20 and some other park2 mutations they're associated with late onset Parkinson's disease which is when people are diagnosed after the age of 50 years old but in either case whether it's early or late Parkinson's disease these mutations have changed the gene a bit right they've changed our instructions for making Parkin and so we end up with a non-functional Parkin protein a Parkin protein that just can't do what it needs to do it can't function properly it can't tag these damaged proteins so that we get rid of them so our last gene that we're going to look at is is over here on chromosome 12 so here's chromosome 12 here I'll just draw it out and the gene that we're interested in is the LR rk2 gene so I'm going to call it lark - it's just a little easier to say and and it sits about here so so lark - gives us the recipe to make the protein dard erin and dart erin helps us do things like turn our cells on and off so that we can control their activity and and send signals around the brain so that different cells can talk to each other and what's really interesting is lark - mutations are actually the most common gene mutation that is associated with Parkinson's disease so this is the gene that we normally see issues with in people that have a genetic form of the disease and with this particular gene people only need to get one mutated copy from either of their parents rather than both so this is an autosomal dominant genetic cause of Parkinson's disease and just like before when when our lark - gene gets mutated we end up with a malformed a damaged dard erin protein being formed right so it's being produced by transcription and translation but because we've damaged the lark - gene in some way the instructions are all wrong so the protein ends up being formed a little differently so it can't function properly in order to carry out its really important roles so we've gone through some of these gene mutations that can as Parkinson's disease but by now you must be wondering yeah I get that I get that Park seven and park two and lark two can get mutated and produce malformed proteins and then they can't do their jobs correctly etc etc but what does that have to do with Parkinson's disease how does that cause Parkinson's disease and that's an excellent question and and the answer as it stands right now is that we actually don't know we don't know how these genes getting mutated and these proteins being malformed we don't know how that actually leads to the disease we just know that we consistently see Parkinson's disease development in people with these gene mutations but we don't yet know kind of step by step how people with these mutations actually develop Parkinson's disease so for now we'll just have to stay tuned into the ongoing research efforts to find out more about this one Putting it all together - Pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease

soul book, holy spirit, Katie Souza, katie souza ministries, offense, Prison Ministry, the 700 club Posted by Cee Harmon Categories: Ministry Outreach TV Elevate Christian Network :: Ministry Outreach TV Jesus is love the Lord wants you in every respect of your life to prosper and be in health but it’s as here soul prospers and so that means he wants your soul to be whole he wants your mind your will your emotions your your faculties of passion in that just to be aligned with him and so today we have a guest that is an expert in this field it’s Katie Souza from expected and ministries and Katie you’ve been studying into this area of the soul and healing for the Soul for a long time now but not only studying you’ve actually been applying with your faith the redemptive power of Jesus Christ his healing blessing is his deliverance power and people are set free all over the world because of your ministry and so we’re just thrilled to have you with us today on the program and I know that you’ve got lots of good nuggets for us so let’s talk about the healing of the soul why is it important well for me it started out as necessity of getting this revelation because I was getting sick with all kinds of things reoccurring issues that would never go away at bladder infections yeast infections sore throats flus fevers and it seemed like I was doing what I’m supposed to do you know I was praying believing the crane and I wasn’t getting the breakthrough and so I knew there was something missing and I didn’t understand what it was and that’s when God began to you know speak to me through that scripture that will prosper and be in health even as our soul prospers and God began to show me how certain things like sin and trauma can wound our souls right you know isaiah 30:26 in the amplified talks about god healing up the brokenhearted and binding up their wounds that came from their sin right so saying that when we sin or when somebody sins against us or ancestors sin it can literally wound us okay and even like for trauma that traumas that we live through divorces losing jobs our children maybe someone passes away in our life those traumas can also wound our soul man you know and a good example of that and the Bible is job remember he went through a lot of trauma right he had all his servants killed and all his his wealth was stolen his children were all killed at the same time when a whirlwind you know crashed the house down on on them and then he himself even got sick physically well those traumas wounded his soul and we know that because throughout the entire book of Job 23 times he says stuff about his soul like I’m mourning and so on vexed and soul my soul is being poured out and it was always him making these statements in connection to the pain the soul pain he was feeling over those traumas and you know Katie if if your soul isn’t that much pain it’s going to affect your quality of life in the same way that if your body like has an injury like let’s say someone you know cut your your arm and you know your tendons are all damaged and everything else then that arms not going to function right and you’re not going to have quality of life so we can’t ignore this area of soul healing in the same way as we wouldn’t be able to ignore the need for a physical healing yeah and even doctors will say that when you live through a traumatic event or something has stressed you and your inner man they don’t even really necessarily call it my soul but they say that 80 to 90% of their patients that have a serious even a deadly illness right have suffered some sort of a event like that than traumatising to them so what happens in here directly affects everything out here including the physical body right and you know when as we go around teaching people how to get healed in their soul we see thousands and thousands of miracles I mean I saw a man grow a lung back right he lost from cancer win without soul healed Wow and I believe the soul the wound that was inside him actually caused the cancer in the first place yeah see a good a good biblical example of sickness and the soul is the man at the Pool of Bethesda remember him said he he had an infirmity for thirty-eight years right that’s a long time to be sick and a lot of people are in that situation exactly today yeah there’s so many mysterious illnesses that even the doctors don’t know how to diagnose because they don’t know how to diagnose the soul hmm I think that’s one of the issues right for the amount of the pool 38 years what was it that made him in that state for that long right well the Bible says he had an infirmity for 38 years if you look at that word infirmity in the Strong’s it means weakness and infirmity of the body and of the soul so was saying that he had wound inside of his inner man that was causing the sickness now where did that wound come front right well it came from sin and we know that from the words of Jesus himself when did he say that man after he got him healed he saw him in the temple he said I see your well now stop sinning right or something worse may happen to you see when we sin or someone sins against us or our ancestors sinned it can wound us and then cause disease right come upon us yeah for sure for sure even demonic oppression you know we see a lot of people you know they’re doing they’re making more with the enemy and and they’re doing what the Bible says to do you know no weapon formed against us shall prosper greater is He that’s in me than he that’s in the world the name of Jesus I command you to leave but they’re not having success or battling that spear and it’s not leaving it could be not every time but it could be because there is a legal landing strip is solely for that spirit to be there and a good example is the woman bowed over with the spirit of infirmity remember her 18 years right her spine is literally bent by a spirit a demon was bending her spine that is like almost beyond our ability to proceed right but nonetheless that’s what the Bible said right so what was allowing that spirit to literally affect her bones like that well it said she had a spirit of infirmity right the same word used to describe the man at the pool right it means infirmity and weakness in the soul right so she had something going on in here that allowed the spirit to be there once we get this healed we’ll start to see a lot of things change will start to see miracles happen in our bodies our minds our marriages our relationships our finances we’ll see our authority over demonic spirits will greatly increase right I mean today Katie you know like there’s a lot of I think frivolous thinking regarding sin issues in the body of Christ I see it everywhere it’s like oh well I’m under grace oh that’s fine it doesn’t matter you know but it really does and the reason why God hates sin so much is because it can damage you or it says it hurts us and he hates anything that hurts us so we don’t want to go navel-gazing as far as oh I’m going to keep looking because if your sin conscious that’s going to destroy you also yes it is but we don’t want to ignore the fact that right that our souls need to be rightly stewarded watch over are your hearts with all diligence because from it flow the issues of life scripture says it’s true you know just like simple things like being offended at somebody let’s say somebody really does you wrong and they really have hurt you and you’ve really not done anything to deserve it right what happens is some people mistakenly respond by becoming offended saying words that person I can’t believe what they did you know how they have the nerve you know they need to repent they’re completely wrong and we begin to complain and be offended well the Bible says in like proverbs 16 I believe it is or proverbs 26 it says the words of a slander or a whisper are like deadly wounds yeah that go down to the innermost part of the being so we think we have the right right you say stuff about this person because they did this and this and this and this right but we’re actually putting deadly wounds on ourselves and causing sickness point oh yeah one of the times I heard you speak on offense it was really enlightening because I think you were sharing a testimony about how you’re walking through an airport and going through the security lines and you’re offended because of you know someone not moving fast enough attending and you know so often things like that happened in all of our lives right every day but we we don’t even think its offense because you know it just feels like you know we’re you know we have a right to say it we have a right to think it I mean after all and it just becomes natural to us but God wants us to come to a place where we are so in tune with his love yes and with his purity and everything that that that will realize no that’s not his nature right it’s not him thinking gosh that’s why I’m feeling like that and so that we can walk free from woundedness by by by being in the healers love in the in in wholeness himself we gotta connect the dots I remember this gentleman in like San Diego he had a severe sinus affection and he had it for years and years and it was so bad it stunk okay was always running and you could smell it people around him could smell it was that bad why when talk about the soul at a meeting and about being offended and he said the prayers and he got instantly healed it dried up the smell left and everything and he was amazed because he never connected this horrible infection with him being offended and it wounding his soul Wow yeah it was amazing yeah well and so one round of repentance and cleansing cleansed everything yes it’s true oh and there’s another thing there too you know i lead people through repentance and that’s the first step we should always particular cross first because jesus died for every sin right including every sin that would ever wound us but there’s something i think that the body of christ is left out of their daily prayer life and that is for taking of something they already have and that’s Dunamis resurrection power that lives in them right so let me just explain what that is okay so the Bible talks about in Romans 1 that we that Paul said I’m not ashamed of the gospel which is the power unto salvation right he’s talking about this power that caused us to become saved born again it’s resurrection power it comes into us and it causes our dead spirit to be resurrected in the new eternal life right right okay will that power that Paul is talking about there in the Greek gets the word Dunamis now this is a this is an amazing power right okay Dunamis is resurrection power it causes us to be born again it comes and lives inside of us so right now every believer has a tankful that never runs out right okay well that word Dunamis if you look it up in the Strong’s one of its meanings is excellence of soul yes I love it so we don’t realize right now we got a tank full oh yeah power that can make us excellent a soul I can heal every single wound we already have it because Jesus is excellent of soul and he is eternal life and he’s dwelling within us and when you just think of like this excellence of Jesus and thought word and indeed lives in on the inside and the heat comes in fills our human soul oh that’s how we’re taken into his image his likeness because he’s living in there and he’s given us that power to heal every bit of woundedness that could ever come upon us when we talked about anything else that we do awesome yes you know we are going to come right back after this message but I want you to get ready to be ministered to we’re going to learn about the power of decree and how decrees can heal your soul there’s going to be miracles and we’re going to pray for those things and if you have need of a miracle right now maybe you have a an infirmity that you’ve lived with for a number of years don’t be surprised if you don’t get a miracle anointing this very day where every symptom lifts off of you we’ll be right back do you feel like your prayers aren’t

the revival fires and release an atmosphere of miracles signs and wonders it’s time for you to arise and be a woman on the front lines okay so Katie tell us more about this Dunamis power because it’s one thing to be able to you know recognize that there’s a need for repentance and that yeah but repentance is one thing but applying that Dunamis power is another yes you know you gotta know for sure that it works cuz Jesus used it that’s what acts 10:38 says God anointed Jesus Christ with Holy Spirit and power which is Dunamis and he went around healing everyone that was oppressed by the devil and when the woman touched Jesus’s the hem of His garment ruin oh right says he felt that healing virtue that word is Dunamis and she had been traumatized by that 12u her long says so I believe he healed her in her soul made her excellence all and healed her physical bodies and even if the issue of blood itself wasn’t related to the soul yeah the shame and everything that came with that condition would have damaged the soul and that’s what I loved about that whole story is that he presented her after she was healed he made sure publicly everyone knew that she was cleansed yeah it’s clear that whole issue I love to care everything he took care of everything Jesus all right now seriously okay so decrees is another good thing now you’re the decree expert you know I’ve read your book the trade and it’s awesome I think everyone needs to incorporate decrees it’s one of the simple ways that you can release the power you already have because if your blood you have and a decree is a governmental proclamation yeah we’ve got the King of Kings the word of the King of Kings that we decree and the the Bible says that when you send forth that word through decree you know that word does not return void it accomplishes everything it is sent to do so it’s powerful it’s active its operative as it says in Hebrews and is so powerful decrees are so powerful yeah you know job talks on we decree a thing and it shall be and she’ll be established so that helps establish and our healing for us in her soul and in her body right it’s so cool cuz you know Jesus made decrees when he would heal people you know he went around saying to people that were crippled and stuff arise right pick up your mat and walk he was releasing a decree to them except well that were to rise it’s so cool because if you look it up but it’s actually a resurrection term it’s the same term used for you know the when when Jairus daughter arose right and when Jesus command us go out heal the sick raise the dead so when he would say to people arise pick up your Matlock he was loosing a decree that was releasing the Dunamis he was carrying beautiful you know and it would heal that person in their in her soul and in their physical body right so that’s what we need to start doing too is start releasing decrees you know that’s why I wrote the book so that people could have a list of them if they didn’t know what to do that it’s called soul a soul decrees and so these are specific decrees to heal the soul and to empower the soul and to come into healing wholeness and an empowerment it’s awesome when they do them then the physical body will follow suit their marriage will follow suit you know every part of them will follow suit their finances will start to prosper right so it’s a good practice that’s a very simple but totally effective way is releasing the Word of God though that’s what James says the word has the power to save our soul yes you know that word say there is so so so it means holy deliver prosper yes awesome using we’ve seen so many things happen and in our in our you know meetings and in our personalized to and it happened through a decree right like I would get a word of knowledge and I would stand on the stage and make a decree say a scripture or say a decree you know I hear someone’s being healed of you know knee problems right now someone being healed of cancer I find and I would speak a scripture and I command that your soul would be prospered by health even as your body would be prospered and brought my health even as your soul prospers and then you know miracles that start to pop pop pop pop pop so it’s very simple for us to do this but so very powerful and Katie you actually have in your ministry you train people how to operate in this it’s not like you’re just up there on the platform doing this just yourself you actually equipped the body to do this and I know people have been under your training we’re out ministering to the sick feeling people’s souls casting out Devils all of that and so thank you so much for your contribution yeah because it’s amazing it’s been super fun but you know people don’t feel like they need me to lay hands on them because I’m teaching them how to do it right you know we’ve just even you know even in my own inner circle my staff and people in in my family in my ministry are getting huge miracles signs and wonders because they’ve learned how to do it you know one of my my very faithful employees john blake had a rare disease where he had ammonia storing in his brain right his body wasn’t releasing it and it would cause him like alzheimer’s like symptoms right he wouldn’t be able to remember remember simple tasks like typing he wouldn’t be able to finish his sentences his wife would have to finish him for him he wouldn’t be able to remember the plot of a movie even though he just watched the movie it was horrible he would spend like $1,500 a month on medications that would prevent him from going into a coma like sleep Wow it was terrible for him and God just released a word a nagy one day to us said it was his soul that there was an issue in the soul and then if we prayed for it it would be healed and he would be healed too and he came over the house and I just you know I prayed over him a decrese soaked him and within I don’t know probably 45 minutes he stood up and the first thing he recognized was that his mind was clear Wow he he could think so much clearer than he had in years and years and then he went home and all his life he’d had this smell of ammonia on his body and all of a sudden he gets in the shower to take a shower and it’s gone right he’s so convinced after the days you know past that he’s healed he has three of his doctors to give a test independently each one all comes back first time in years his ammonia level is normal it’s awesome it was awesome awesome a lot of times people think that you know like when the soul gets healed and then the physical body responds but it also affects other areas I can there John it says in every respect yes in all respects of life I want you to prosper and be in health even as your soul prospers so that could be also your prosperity of provision yes your prosperity of relationships and that and you’ve seen miracles in those areas as well especially in financial breakthroughs in people’s lives and you know as you yes you know seeing clearance in the area of the soul then other things come into alignment as well I’ve had huge financial miracles given to me and the ministry because I got my soul healed and it was so cool God would always connect the miracle with the provision coming in like something would happen I would have an awareness that there was an issue my soul like I’m sure most reviewers know my history I think I used to be a criminal in the streets I would rob people I knew in federal prison I was a federal prison I sold dope I was a collector I forced people to pay debts by gunpoint and I remember when the ministry started really taking off the Lord said you can’t continue to carry around those wounds in your soul that came from all that sin right because now I have to trust you to steward faithfully right and with integrity millions of dollar right and that’s no joke and we take that seriously I mean we’re members of the ECF a that’s how serious and I just want to say knowing you personally for like since you started in ministry really is I want to say how much I appreciate your integrity you’re a woman of virtue you are a woman who truly has watched over her soul and you watch over the finance of the ministry as unto the Lord in such a beautiful way and I want to commend you for that and your husband and your team we have gone out of our way we have independent audits done on us all the time to make sure that every eye you know is dotted every T is crossed and we’ve done really well in that we feel really happy that God has allowed us to work in that in that level of integrity but in all we can’t just say well let me just say this because I think this is so important there are so many Christiane’s you know you’re saved you’re you’re you know you you love the Lord but when you don’t watch over your soul in the area financial stewardship and when you don’t have integrity in that area how can we be trusted with true riches how can we really steward what God has us to Stewart so I just want you to examine your heart so you know and say am i stewarding my finances the way that God wants me to store them and especially if you’re a Christian minister and you are storing the funds that come into the ministry I know @xp we are very very serious about the way funds are handled and that nothing gets wasted and that we’re we’re careful with expenditures in that and so please you know I just make an appeal to you to make sure there’s alignment in that area and I think let me go to that see when we have woundedness inside of us it controls every part of our soul the way we think about the money the decisions we make with the money and we can even get emotional with the money and and we have to be healed in our soul right now in that parable of the talents remember the master leaves and goes his servants talents we said that he gave three of his servants talents according to their abilities right did you know that word ability there is the word Dunamis really well you can almost read it like this excellence of soul right it means that he gave them talents according to the exercise oh wow we have the Dunamis in notes we all have the same mana tournament yeah we all have a tankful that never runs out but how much of it is that working us right how much of in are we releasing how much are we going okay I I want to make sure I am totally operating with utmost integrity in my finances so I want and releases Dunamis I already have from my spirit in my soul to heal every wound in my soul that might be connected to finances right I repent for anything I’ve done you know bad stewardship wastefulness AXS extortion anything an enemy soul that needs money to make it feel good yeah you know the idolatry of it yes I remember some people there are adorable people that love Jesus they had gotten an inheritance and they called me so would you please help us decide what to to you know invest in and so I began to pray with them and I said you know I feel like you’re supposed to wait until you get more healing in your soul before you move on then that night the the wife has a dream she has a huge diamond and these zombies are trying to steal it from her she calls me and tells me the dream and I said oh my gosh it’s what I told you see zombies are the walking dead right that’s what soul wounds are there are things that are supposed to be dead but they’re still alive and kicking and they’re trying to eat your stuff Wow okay and I said they’re trying these soul wounds are gonna try to steal your diamond your watch don’t make a move until you get more healing they didn’t listen though and they lost it all oh they lost every penny we have to be so careful we need to be healed in here first yes then God will give us more finances because he can trust us and when you make decrees over your soul that actually helps fortify the healing though we just have a couple minutes left I love to minister to the people so why don’t you go as a spirit lead too and let’s release healing to soul wounds all right let’s work on the finances because so many people need help in that area let’s just ask God to first cleanse us of any sin we might have committed with our finances so why don’t we just pray together okay just say Lord Jesus our repent for anything sinful that I have done with my finances our repent for excess bad stewardship extortion gambling Ussery manipulation in Jesus name all sin I’ll repent for that’s connected to my finances I put the blood of Jesus on it I’m just saying into that okay now let’s do the second step because if you don’t if you don’t start releasing Dunamis in you you won’t become excellent of soul that wound will still be their sins gone but the wound stays behind controlling you okay so not just put your hand on your belly and just say Jesus I released what I already have I have a tank full of Dunamis and I release it now to go into my soul to every woundedness in me that’s controlling my finances send Dunamis into my mind so I think right thoughts about money send it to my will so I get healed and make right decisions about my money and send it into my emotions so I don’t make emotional decisions with my finances to say I release the Dunamis now decree I am excellent of soul in Jesus name Amen awesome thank you so much Katie we want to thank

a whole lot of flippin I want you to go to second Chronicles if you will and I’m going to actually begin at the first verse and then I’ll try to call it out as I go but I’m excited for God’s a word thank you praise team band everybody for taking us into the presence of the Lord beginning at the first verse the Bible said sometime later the Moabites and the ammonites accompanied by the me unites they join forces to make war on Jehoshaphat verse 3 shaken Jehoshaphat prayed because sometimes when you really shake it to the cordless that’s what you do so shaken Joseph had prayed and he went to God for help and he ordered a nationwide fast the country of Judah United in seeking God’s help and they came from all the cities of Judah to pray to God go to verse 25 and when Jehoshaphat and his people came to carry off the plunder they found more loot than they could carry off equipment clothing valuables as a matter of fact it took three days to cart it away and on the fourth day they came together at the valley of blessing Baraka and they blessed God that’s how it got its name the valley of blessing now just a few verses earlier in verse three shaken some translations say was trouble he was worried he was bothered but here now just a few late verses later and there’s a whole lot of stuff that happened in between and I’m gonna try to hit the highlights of it today but I want to just talk for a few moments from a particular subject look to your neighbor on your right and say neighbor being overwhelmed by the battle – being overloaded by the blessing tell somebody else being overwhelmed by the battle to being overloaded by the blessing it all happened in a day’s journey from overwhelmed to overloaded well not just overloaded with troubles of burden of pressure but overloaded by the blessing sphere to God we thank you for your word it’s a timely word we honor you your word is always on time I pray for the anointing to deliver it into this room thank you for touching your people thank you for speaking confirmation in this house somebody came to hear have your way in here today God take over this room right now just take it over see what you want to say and do what you want to do and will thank you for it in Jesus name somebody just stand there for a second clap your hands and give God a praise in advance come on praise Him in advance for finding you today for speaking to you today for giving you a word that you can walk out here with and live with all week long thank you too dad god I thank you today for your word in Jesus name Amen and amen on your way down just hit somebody tell him from overwhelmed too overloaded overwhelmed to overload it y’all got to say Amen real loud because I can’t really see y’all good because the lights are in my face so I know you out there cuz of philia but say man every now and then thank you thank you y’all are awesome one of the most common complaints that that I hear or common phrases or common sentences or words that I hear today and probably you here too is is the phrase I am just over well over well now most of the time the people who say that they’re telling you the truth because there is a lot today that we can find ourselves overwhelmed by there’s this there’s just too many decisions that have to be made there’s one of the worst things I can stand it is when I you know cuz I will usually spend Saturday prepping for today and I come in here and preach this first service out preach second service and when church is over if my I can’t take it when my family looks at me and says where are we going to eat I just want to bop him upside the head cuz I haven’t been listening and hearing and I’ve been focused and I’ve been delivering and I made a I’ve made a hundred decisions in the last 24 hours if not more on what we’re doing right here right now and so the last thing that I want you to say to me is where are we going to eat so if you have a catering business we would love frite no I’m just kidding I’m just kidding most of the time I want to go home and go to bed because I’m just wore out but but I feel like it can just in case somebody one somebody make a decision on where we can go eat so that I can I can just walk out here and you say here’s where we’re going to eat today obviously nobody can do that so but the truth of the matter is is that there are so many decisions if you really stop to count the decisions that you make every day of your life you would be shocked to know how many decisions you make there’s just there’s there’s so many expectations that you that you and I feel like we have to meet there’s calls that have to be returned or you have to make the decision not to return the calls there’s there is request that you have to fulfill there are emails that you have to answer or you don’t answer and there are there are social media inbox messages so and then if that’s not enough on Instagram then you got to go to Facebook and they’ve got inboxes and we got so many boxes we’re about to be boxed in is what we’re about to be we’ve got friend requests that we should answer we’ve got and then when we go home and sit down and turn the TV on we have too many channels to choose from I just just overwhelmed I’m like when I was a kid we had three channels abies CBS and NBC that was it and they went off at two o’clock in the morning but they like that today and now we got so many things and then when you do decide to go somewhere to eat some of these restaurants there the menus are so complicated you just want to shut it like don’t even go to the Cheesecake Factory I’m just telling you never go there when you’re tired and when you’re really hungry because you’re just like what what is all of this right here you know I I got tickle s yesterday because I was reading a story about this woman who said that she she said I moved into a new apartment and I was glad to begin there and that by the time I’m getting everything unloaded unpacked I realized I don’t have a toilet brush for the bathroom so she said I went to Amazon and I started looking for a toilet brush she said do you know they sell on Amazon they sell 1161 different kinds of taller brushes now imagine that she said after about an hour of comparing the brushes and comparing the price difference in the brushes and reading all the conflicting reviews that came with all of the brushes she said I finally just got up got dressed I jumped in my car I drove to the local dollar store I walked in and I bought the only brand of toilet brushes that they sold there’s so many options and the more that our options increase our level of certainty about our choices begins to decrease because when you you make a choice you say okay I’m gonna use this I’m gonna take that and but because you have so many options you’re like I don’t know I I don’t know if that’s what I should do or if I should and the next thing you know you’re just consumed she said I wasted an hour just looking at all the reviews and the prices and comparing and I just wanted to toll it rush nobody was gonna see if it was just a toilet brush I mean it’s crazy the options that are out there today have you went to the coffee aisle in the grocery store Lee I mean if you’re a if you’re a newcomer to coffee you are gonna be confused as I don’t know what because there are so many options that are in how about toothpastes have you ever looked at how many options we have with toothpaste listen I just want spearmint I want peppermint all right I just want gel I want pace listen why do I have to go through all of that stuff just give me something that will help me and help people that come in contact with me and God forbid that you ever get a cold because if you ever have to go to the medicine aisle listen you go to the medicine aisle they say do you want something for runny eyes or do you want something for runny nose do you flu symptoms or do you have a cold is your ears burning or are they tingling or are they ringing is this your sinuses or is this your allergies or do you want non-drowsy or drowsy do you want 12 hours or do you want 24 hours what do you want I want you to go away that’s what I want seriously it can be totally overwhelming I mean I used to think Baskin Robbins 31 flavors was overwhelming it’s a breeze now when I was a kid I thought it was overwhelming because as I grew up we only had chocolate or vanilla and occasionally we would have Neapolitan does anybody know any apologies all my old folks they know what that is that’s that’s that’s when you get all three vanilla chocolate and strawberry so those are fun things that we can laugh about it comes to being overwhelmed but there are some serious things today that are overwhelming people people are overwhelmed by their debt it seems like just it’s just overwhelming the way especially if you have credit card debt how it can just the compound interest and god forbid that we would ever oh that I rs anything because they’re gonna get compound interest they’re gonna get penalties they’re gonna get all of that stuff people are overwhelmed student loans they they are there they’re overwhelmed by child care costs like I have to have a family I want to have a family but I make it costs me just as much to put them in in daycare as it does I feel sorry for kids today people today I didn’t have all those options when when my kids were coming up and but to think about it today it gets overwhelming people get overwhelmed by health care costs like do I do I do I do I pay for my medicine or do I repair the roof that’s over my head you know it’s just it gets overwhelming and then and then yours there’s your workload you’ve got to work and you got this load and just as soon as you think you have got your desk pretty much cleared off here comes about a truckload of other things and next thing you know it’s out of control people are overwhelmed by regret they’ve been through stuff then it’s it and they’ve got so much regret that it just stays present and forefront in their minds they’re over there overloaded by shame they’re overloaded by guilt they’re overloaded by worry and by fear some people are overloaded by the by the lack of security they want to be and want to have more security overwhelmed by pain overwhelmed by loss overwhelmed by anger overwhelmed by by grief overwhelmed by resentment and bitterness overwhelmed by the conflict between you and your kids or if everything’s good between you and your kids it’s between your kids and your kids and it’s just so much so so much as it’s causing us to be overwhelmed should we stay here should we move should we do this should we do that it’s it’s it can be absolutely overwhelmed it if you weren’t overwhelmed when I got up you’re overwhelmed right now overwhelmed in our families overwhelmed in our marriages we’re living in the same house but we’re also living in two different worlds it can be overwhelming what do you do when you find yourself overwhelmed and so today that’s that’s what I want to talk about in the man that’s gonna help me talk about that is that I I really like him he’s a cool guy his name is Josh AFET I mean listen a name like that is overwhelming can you imagine can you imagine when you go to kindergarten please spell your name spell jaws how many syllables in my name that’s overwhelming can you imagine what he what he felt like when he had to write and imagine his nickname think about that people that didn’t want to call him Joe ha stuff that they probably just called him Jay fat or fat you know it’s just that’s overwhelming in and of itself hello can Jay fat come out and play today it’s crazy but I really like Jehoshaphat I like him because he’s a good guy he was a good King and he is a really good leader he had a strange name and I don’t know why his mother did that but anyway I hope you’re naming jaha’s have had him here today just come down here right now I’m gonna pray for you so the Bible tells us that that he was a great leader he led the entire nation of Israel into a revival it was it was just a reviving that he brought death to them and in second chronicles 19 and 4 the Bible says that King Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and he went among the people from bear Sheva to the mountains of Ephraim and he brought them back to the Lord God of their fathers he went to all of the little cities he didn’t just go to the big cities he went to all the little cities he went to where the real people lived and he got down with him and he hung out with him and by doing this he caused them to turn their hearts back to God you would be amazed to know just how far it how far reaching your willingness to come to where people are what would really go it could possibly cause them to turn their hearts back to God and so because of his efforts that he was a great success and there was a great spiritual awakening that came to Israel it was really he and the spiritual awakening was very good for the nation of Israel however we all know that that good is often going to be followed by something bad if we can just be honest today it’s a good time but you can’t hardly enjoy the good time for fear of what the bad time is going to bring we know that for every mountaintop you can always expect that there will be a valley we know that with every high somewhere there’s going to be a low we know that with every setup there’s probably somebody waiting in the wings to set you back it’s just life it’s it’s it’s how it’s it’s how it is there’s always the day after the wedding everybody looks forward to the wedding it’s exciting you build to order but then there’s the day after when it’s all over if there’s the day after Christmas we’re excited about Christmas but then you wake up the next day after Christmas and your kids are already bored and you don’t spend a thousand dollars on a little toys and they look at you and say can we go to Chuck E Cheese you know it’s it’s the day after the Super Bowl party everybody’s excited on the day but then there’s the day you wake up and it’s over how about the New Year’s Eve party everybody’s excited New Year’s Eve it’s all changing we’re getting everything behind us hallelujah but then you wake up in is January 1st and we’re just back to our routine so on a personal note I I have noticed that on the heels of most every one of my life’s greatest blessings or greatest achievements or greatest victories or one of my life’s greatest testimonies right on the heel heels of that there will always come a test anybody ever noticed that it’s just you no sooner get through celebrating till you realize oh shoot I’m in the middle of another test and this this particular happens it particularly happens when we make a fresh commitment to God anybody ever made a fresh commitment to God you’re in church on Sunday and you’re excited tears are rolling down your face you feel God you’re like God I’m gonna be I’m gonna change my life bringing my life into alignment with you I’m getting my house in order Cod I’m gonna get it all together and and next thing you know here comes a test without fail that happens and and sometimes the test comes through people that you love because not everybody is happy about your commitment to Christ and somebody is going to challenge your decision the enemy’s going to always make sure that somebody is there to challenge your decision somebody is gonna be angry because you have made up in your mind I’ve changed uniforms today I’ve changed sides I’ve changed ugly gence as I am in the Lord’s army today somebody is going to be upset at that upset about that because anytime you are the friend of God you are the enemy of Satan it just happens to work like that and and so that’s that’s what happens here that’s what was happening here in second chronicles chapter 20 and verse 1 it says in the King James or in the New King James it says after this after this after what after after the spiritual awakening happened that I just told you about after this the armies of the Moabites the ammonites and some of the Mia Knights declared war on Jehoshaphat of course they did because we just come through a great celebration so he is the king of a small country called Israel and three of his his enemies that get together and they decide that they’re going to gang up on him you ever felt like the life just ganged up on you maybe I’m preaching to the wrong Church by I’m gonna find somebody else to preach this to cuz they’ll get it I said do you ever feel like life just has ganged up on you so then the Bible says then then some messengers came and they told you Hoss effete in an inner that a great multitude or a huge combined army is coming against you and they’re coming from the Dead Sea and Jehoshaphat starts feeling overwhelmed because his enemies are ganging up on him and and I and I know it that’s that’s like sometimes you feel like I don’t know where you’ve been hit on the right and then as soon as you’re like pulling yourself together from that here comes something out on the left and and you’re being hit on every side by by the enemy and it seems like everything was going right but now it’s all going wrong at the same time anybody know what I’m talking about anybody had a week like that so that’s what King Jehoshaphat was feeling and things were going good the nation was was in revival all of a sudden he hears that the three armies of his enemies have United together and they are on their way to destroy him so now he’s facing a triple threat and he did just to be honest he’s a king but he is overwhelmed the Bible says that shaken Jay said yeah that’s what I’m gonna call him Jay fat said himself to seek the Lord he’s overwhelmed he’s scared and he’s shaken but look what he does he sets himself to seek the Lord he went to God for help and he also ordered that the entire nation make a sacrifice and begin a fast now there’s a lesson right there in that all by itself wouldn’t you feel overwhelmed by a problem do not let that problem intimidate you but make it motivate you to pray more okay why why should I be intimidated when I can be motivated look at somebody and say don’t be intimidated be motivated I’m overwhelmed but at the same time I’m more motivated to seek God in prayer I’m motivated to trust him more I’m motivated to believe more I’m motivated to depend and lean upon him more I’m overwhelmed but I’m also expecting more so you won’t either do one of the other you’ll be intimidated and you’ll back up or you’ll say oh right and you’ll become motivated and you’ll get yourself ready for whatever you have to get yourself ready so the first thing that Joseph had does is he makes it a matter of personal prayer the second thing that he does is he gets not only himself but he tells the whole nation around him to pray I want you to look at your neighbor and say neighbor I dare you to pray about it now look at that same neighbor and say back to their neighbor I dare you to pray about it see well what I want to pull from this story today there are five things that I’m gonna give you that Jehoshaphat did when he felt overwhelmed so if you are in this place get your iPad get pin get something out because I’m gonna give you something to take home with you today because I want you to put this in practice every time that you feel as if you are overwhelmed and and you know what if you don’t feel like you’re overwhelmed today take this down anyway cuz one of these days you’re gonna wake up and see where is that message pastor Brady was preaching about being overwhelmed so I want you to write this down what do you do when you’re overwhelmed the first thing that Jay fat did what he did I person said it the first thing that Jehoshaphat did when he let me say it like this there are five things he did and they worked for him and I would almost stake my life on it today that what I’m getting ready to tell you if that they work for him but they’re gonna work for you too I’m telling you I’m convinced up there there are five thinks the first thing that there are five right moves that he made when he was overwhelmed when you’re overwhelmed you can’t afford to make a wrong move so I need you to write this down the five write loses one of the first write moves he made was he turned to God write that down the first right move he made was he turned to God he didn’t turn to friends he didn’t turn to his military capabilities he didn’t turn to his weapons he didn’t turn to human reasoning he didn’t turn to social media to take it out on social media he didn’t turn to to rant to anybody he didn’t turn to his followers he didn’t start developing a plan there’s nothing wrong with the plan everybody needs a plan but before you develop a plan you need to pray and as you pray God will give you his plan and not your plan okay so you’ve got to turn to prayer before you turn to your plan prayer should be our first choice and not our last resort I said prayer should be our first choice and not our last resort oftentimes we wait till we get to the point where prayer is the last thing that we can do we’ve all heard people say well all we can do now is just you’re heard somebody say that before all we can do now is just pray we’ve done tried everything we know and so all we’re gonna do right now is we’re just gonna put it in the hands of God and we’re going to pray no we should have prayed before you ever done anything else prayer should have been our first choice and not our last resort I’m so most say until somebody hears it today God is saying you’re not praying to me you’re asking everybody else you’re trying to work it in your head you’re trying to figure out how you can do it you’re trying to make your next move and God said stop a minute and talk to me about it you should go straight to God and say God I got trouble coming from everywhere I’ve got financial trouble I’ve got to help him tails issues I got family trouble I got emotional trouble Lord I’m spiritually in trouble and I need your help somebody said I need your help that’s what Jay Joseph had did Jehoshaphat said not only am I gonna pray about it he said but I’m gonna get this entire nation to pray he said the country in in verse 4 in the message he says the country of Judah United in seeking God’s help they came from all of the cities of Judah to pray to God see once it gets the whole nation to pray once it gets gets everybody all the national leaders to come together and pray then he opens up his mouth okay first he’s just praying to God second he gets everybody else in there to pray with him but then when everybody gets there he publicly opens his mouth and he starts calling on the name of the Lord sometimes you can’t just pray in your head and you can’t just bring in your heart sometimes you got to open your mouth and let everybody around you hear you call on God sometimes he wants to hear your voice and then good enough for me to pray for you some situations you got to pray for yourself he did that that’s leadership right there that’s amazing leadership right there if we could get some of our political people our spiritual people our social leaders our local leaders our national leaders to come together and pray to lay aside denomination and pray just set aside our differences and pray to put our logos and our egos in the floor and just begin to pray I believe that we would hear from heaven did somebody say man right there cuz there’s no problem that is too big and there is no problem that is too small for us to pray about if it’s big enough for you to worry about it’s big enough for you to pray about hallelujah so I want to teach you exactly how he prayed because I believe that if you’ll apply this to your life when you’re overwhelmed let’s go work for you too so so what did I say the first thing he did was he turned to God for help okay and then in verses all the way down from verses 6 to verses 12 he asks God for questions he asks are you not do you not is there not will you not each one of those requests was a way of praying to God because of of heat because of the fact that he was under attack so the first thing he said that the Bible says he did he turned to God in prayer the second thing that he did was he focused on God and not the problem now hear me I know that’s going right over your head today and you’re adding think about going in one ear and out the other but I dare you to apply this to your life he’s focused on God and not his problem have you have you have you asked anybody the question like have you ever just looked and say hey how are you doing and their answer is B will be like well under the circumstances I’m doing okay well number one why are you under the circumstance you need be on top of the circumstances okay not on dirt but on top all right circumstances are like a mattress if you get on top of it you’ll rest if you get underneath it you’re gonna suffocate tell somebody to get on top get on top so when you need when you pray you need to turn your focus off of the problem and turn your focus on to the solution turn your focus on to God and if you continue here’s why because if you continue to look at the negative if you continue to focus on the problem where the focus goes the power flows and what was little becomes big big big big and bigger so if you focus on the lack the black is gonna get bigger if you focus on the problem the problem will get bigger if you focus on the negative all the negativity is going to get bigger and you will continue to feel overwhelmed so Jehoshaphat made the decision in prayer and he asked it for ways I told him to put I got my notes y’all gotta up up under number two I want you to write a B C and D here’s the four ways he did it when he began to pray the Bible said he remembered how big God was he remembered how big God was the bigger you realize how you’re God the bigger that you recognize how big your God is the smaller your your problem is going to become your problem is going to shrink when God expands in your life do you understand that when God gets big the problem gets small so you me and here’s why because he is all-powerful he is always in control he is all-knowing there is nothing that is too hard for him and with God all things are possible so he said in verse 6 are you not God in heaven this is how this man is praying are you not God in heaven do you not rule over the kingdoms of the nations and is your hand and in your hand is there not power and is there not mine so that no one is able to withstand you when’s the last time you went to God like that he called God out that’s exactly what he did he’s saying yeah I’ve got some problems but I know this I know that you are bigger than my problems so he remembered how big God was second thing he did is he remembered what God had done in the past well write that down you gotta remember what God has done in the past he said I realized that I’ve been in tough times and tight places before but I also know that I’m still here I know that I have survived them I know that I have come through them I know that I have outlasted them I know that I have outlived them because I know and whom I have believed and I and persuaded that he was able and if that God did it from me then the same God that did it for me then is gonna do it for me right now look at somebody say he’ll do it again so he said in verse 7 he says Oh God did you not drive out those who lived in this land before you brought your people Israel here he’s reminding God you did this before he’s saying hey aren’t you the one that brought us here we didn’t even come here ourselves we didn’t ask to be here you’re the one that established us you brought us in and you brought us in through Abraham and then we went down into Egypt and we got enslaved for 400 years and when Moses brought us back did you not take care of those enemies for us then and now they’re trying to return and here we are trying to get in our homeland and you took care of them you wiped them out from us and now God here they come again he says you took care of them back then and you took care of them in my past you won’t take care of them in my future do you hear the confidence he’s saying I know who you are and I know what you’re able to do if you don’t know that in your belly then you’ll never get anywhere in God but you at some point you’ve got to say I know you are and I know what kind of power you had you need to remind yourself when you are feeling overwhelmed that one God is a big card and number two if he helped you before he will help you again and then I love how he starts recollecting this in verse 9 he said you helped us when we face disasters you were there for us when we were in wars you there went disease hit us you were there when we were facing famine he said I remember how big you are I remember what you have done and here’s the third one I remember what you promised well look at your neighbor and say neighbor you got to know what he’s promised there are 7,000 promises in the Word of God and a sure sign that you don’t know what God has promised to you is the fact that you worry you can’t worry and believe his promise at the same get somebody tell him I believe God I believe God Jehoshaphat said God I know how I know you’re big I know what you’ve done and I also know what you promised does anybody know what God has promised you he said I know what you promised and because of that he said I’m up staying on your promise did he did you not give this land to your friend Abraham and to his descendants and did you not give it to us forever you did not put a time frame on this you said this was ours forever didn’t you promise this property to us did you say this was our land didn’t you say this was our parking lot did you say this was our church didn’t you say this was my house did you call it the promised land on purpose so I want to know how you gonna keep your word God are you gonna let these three enemies come in and try to wipe us out he’s overwhelmed but his confidence is coming back I can hear it he said I remember how big you are I remember what you’ve done and I remember what you promised fourth thing he said I remember your character he said I know what kind of God you are I know that you’re a good god I know that you’re a faithful God I know that you’re a loving God I know that you’re a fair God I know that you’re an honest God I know that you are just and I know that you are even-handed so here let me really quick in one minute give you just a little backdrop to this story for hundreds of years earlier when Moses got the Jews out of slavery and started brought them back to the promised land there were three tribes that had already moved in while Israel had been enslaved three tribes and their names were the Amorite the Moabites and the me unites and God specifically told the Jews as he was bringing them in don’t worry about them don’t fight them let them live right there leave them alone let them stay where they are he said I don’t want you to fight them I don’t want you to wipe them out I don’t want you to get into this battle because this battle is not yours just leave them on the right side of the Jordan so now you’re up to date a hundred years later there are three tribes and now they are uniting together attempting to try to destroy Israel are you kidding me we could have wiped you out when we came back but we let you live their wing charge you no rent we you stay right where you were we were obeyed God we could have killed you but we’ll let you live and now you gonna get together and act like you don’t kill us you are kidding me so you know it’s awesome that does he immediately goes to appealing to the character of God and he does it in verse 10 in verse 12 and he said look here you didn’t let us touch them when we got here at first we detoured around them we did not lay a hand on them and now they have come to kick us out of the country God that you gave us oh dear God won’t you take care of them we are helpless before these vandal hordes ready to attack us we don’t know what to do we are looking unto you so do you see what Jehoshaphat is doing right there he’s saying God I don’t know how to fix it but I’m turning to you I’m overwhelmed I don’t have the answers there is no way I am going into battle because the odds are against us it’s three armies two one if I take our armies in there their army in there that we are going to lose so I’m turning to you and I’m choosing to focus on you and I’m gonna focus on the problem promise and not the problem but but he said in doing so I’m gonna remind you number one how big you are you’re all-powerful you’re all knowing you’re all able you’re capable number two I’m gonna remind you what you’ve done for me in the past you’ve been there before you helped us out of tighter places than this I’m gonna remind you number three what you promised us about our future I’m calling you out on the gaudy then you said it or you didn’t either you gonna do it or you’re not going to it and I’m asking you God keep your word keep your word to my family keep your word to my household keep your word keep your promise to me and number four he said I’m I’m gonna ask you to fulfill your character I’m gonna asked you to be who you are well okay so y’all got that all that is up under number two I ain’t got time to wait I gotta keep moving so the thing that Jehoshaphat did that was right that you got to do what I got to do that’s right his number one he turned to God for help number two he focused on God and not the problem the third thing that he did that was right he admitted his inability he admitted his inability the first step toward victory in any area of your life is to come out of denial and admit that you can’t fix this I can’t do it on my own I can’t get out of debt on my own I cannot find a job on my own I cannot pay back these school loans on my own I can’t raise these kids on my own I cannot face retirement on my own I’m overwhelmed and I am admitting to you my in abilities that’s what that goes all the way back to that thing that gives you grace when you come before God and say I’m gonna tell you people think I got it together but the truth is I ain’t got it together I can’t fix it if you don’t help me if you don’t fix it it’s not going to be fixed he said we are helpless and we don’t know what to do what is he saying right there he’s saying we don’t have the power and we don’t have the knowledge oh it’s hard to admit that you don’t have the power and you don’t have the knowledge you are the king you’re that king of your world and you find it hard to go to God and say look I’m powerless I’m helpless and I don’t know how to do this and I love what the next verse says he said now all of Judah this was the real men with their little ones who with their wife’s so they weren’t ashamed they didn’t have these milli goes okay cuz they knew what they were in trouble they let their wives and their children see them calling on the name of Jesus they stood before God together and the wives just didn’t wait on the husband’s the wife’s began to pray out to God cover our house cover our family cover our children why because if one of us can put a thousand to flight two of us can put ten thousands of flight and the Bible said that the whole Potter’s House Lord I mean the whole nation started calling on the name of the Lord what do you do when you’re overwhelmed hit somebody and tell them get honest before God my marriage looks like an angle make it God this dream looks like you will never come to pass the plans that I have are all jacked up I need you to help me if you don’t help me I’ll never get a harvest if you don’t help me I’m not gonna make it so what do you do when you’re overwhelmed you pour your heart out you poor young nuts out and you surrender everything to God you turn it over to him and you trust him and when you do here’s how God responds he said in the fifteenth verse he said listen all of you are Judah you inhabitants of Jerusalem and you took King Jason thus says the Lord to you don’t be afraid but that it happened till he got honest that didn’t happen until he was got honest privately and he got honest publicly it’s sad when your title won’t let you access the help that’s right in your house in your home in your business and your family because you got to keep being who you are defeat it at all but when he cried when he gathered people around him that have the same heart the same mind the same vision the voice of the Lord begin to speak do not be afraid don’t be dismayed because of this great multitude why why why are you telling me that because this battle is not yours this battle is God well listen to me I’m your pastor I love you I want your marriage to make it I want your children to make it I want you to make it I want you to get out of debt I want you to get to where you can live comfortably in God but I’m gonna tell you the truth and I can tell you because I know what I’m talking about the reason that were stressed out the reason that we’re exhausted the reason that our marriages are falling apart the reason that we’re weary in well-doing the reason that were checked out the reason that were wore out the reason that were burned out is because we are trying to fight battles that are not ours to fight you’ve got a discern what is your battle and what is the Lord’s you don’t have the energy you don’t have the knowledge you don’t have the power and the reason that we’re feeling frantic about all of this stuff is because we’re trying to be God we are not God God is God I said God is God God is saying did I ever ask you Jos a pet to fight these three armies Oh No haven’t I always taken care of you yeah you’ve always taken care of us haven’t I made some promises to you well I don’t know who I am talking to today and who God brought me here to preach to but I came to tell somebody that God brought me here to tell you that this battle is not yours this battle is the Lord’s this problem is not your yell that big thing that’s in your face right now God said that thing right there this ain’t your battled this ain’t your problem this is not your situation it’s not yours to fix it is God’s to fix and if you stop trying to fix what God has not called you to fix then you will stop being a failure because you’re in over your head and God said I want you to humble yourself I’m wanting you to swallow your pride and I’m wanting you to invite me into your struggle but we keep failing oh god I’m such a failure I messed up I’m so sorry hold up you did not let me down cuz you never held me up to begin with I won’t tell you that right now oh you ain’t that powerful see some of us you have you ever have you ever have you ever sat on a plane and you know it’s getting ready to run down it’s going down the runways getting ready to take off have you ever just started flapping your wings like it was your responsibility for that plane to take off some of you are exhausted right now because you’re walking around flapping your rings trying to get your dream off the ground trying to get your business off the ground trying to get your relationships off the ground you’ve been flapping so hard and you have been doing so long that now you’re about to give up you’re about to throw in the towel you’re about to quit hello and God is saying right back to you uh listen go ahead quit in whatever you know whatever you need to do he said it’s about time it’s about time you give up because that is not the strategy I gave you the strategy I gave you is something different and if you start trying to make it happen and just let it happen you will find out that you got some jet engines attached to you and those jet engines will do all the lifting tell somebody let God do the heavy lifting you’re slapping and all you’re flapping in the world is never going to be enough come on somebody repeat this with me God is God and I’m not God is God and I’m not close your eyes and say it God is God and I I am NOT God the Sun in verse 17 you will not need to fight in this battle look at somebody and tell him it ain’t your battle position yourself he said you ain’t gonna have to fight but this is what you’re gonna have to do position yourself stand still but stand still and see us you know what salvation means the complete deliverance spirit soul and body stand still and see the salvation of the Lord who is with you old Judah is with you all Jerusalem and that happened Jeff had bowed his head and with his face to the ground and all Judah and all of the inhabitants of Jerusalem they bow down before the Lord and they started worshiping the Lord he’s saying boy you can worry or you can worship you can panic or you can praise you can run or you can rest and sometimes it takes more courage to do nothing than it does to do something be stale rest relax and stand firm here’s the fourth thing I got a stop for a thing that he did what was right he thanked God in advance but verse 21 after talking it over with the people Jehoshaphat appointed aquire for God so he’s like ok just say not battle but this is our opportunity to worship I want you to sing and I want you to sing and I want you to say and the Bible said that he he we dressed them in holy robes they even had they even had choir robes Thank You Hafsah fans today and he said I’m dressed him in holy robes and they were to march ahead of the troops and they were to sing and to give thanks to God because his love endure it forever so you got the army back here and you got the choir out there that’s Judah out there and you got the fighter back here look at somebody say sends you the first since universe send you Bray’s out first that’s what he was doing he was sent the praises out in advance and oh hear me today Church and when you start to thanking God in advance for miracles I’m telling you God tells miraculous sometimes we gotta stand still and say thank you sometimes we gotta stand there and when we want to move we gotta resist the urge to move and say nobody it’s my job just to say thank you and the Bible said as in verse 22 as soon as they started praising and shouting to God somebody say at that moment at that moment if you were smart you would be like oh god I just thank you right now that moment God sets ambushment against the men of Amnon against Moe who did it who did it they didn’t have to do it God did it and as they were as they sang the men of Amnon of Moab and Mount Sierra as they were attacking Judah they started attacking Judah they started attacking the praises and next thing you know God got involved and all of them ended up dead can y’all pull it up can y’all pull up verse 24 verse 24 pull it up on the screen so it saved me a minute’s time verse 24 hello okay so when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness they looked toward the multitude and they were dead bodies these are the people that were coming after us keep it going keep it going there were dead bodies they had fallen on the earth and no one had escaped keep going and when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil they found among them an abundance of valuables on the dead bodies did somebody say I’m going in for the kill I’m going in for the kill there was precious jewellery which they stripped off for themselves more than they could even carry away and they were that for three days you’re alone three days three days they were saya three days just gathering up the spoil and they did that because there was so much keep going keep going and on the fourth day they assembled in the valley of Baraka for their they bless the Lord I bet you better bless the Lord therefore the name of that place was called the valley of Baraka until this day keep it going and then they returned every man of Judah and Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat in front of them so it was Judah in front of them now Jehoshaphat is there he said Jehoshaphat said to them go back to Jerusalem and boy y’all better go back with joy I’m telling somebody in this place when you go home today you better go back with joy why why because the law I had made them rejoice over their enemies keep going so they came to Jerusalem and they got strained instruments they got harps they got trumpets and they took it to the house of the Lord and the fear of God was on all the kingdoms I bet there was the kingdoms whose countries when they heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel keep going then the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet why in other words all of his enemies shut up because God I don’t I don’t know for in the message version because I think mine reads a little bit different but all of his enemies shut down why cuz they heard about how not how they fought they’re better yeah see people might be a match for you they’re not a match for your God here’s the fifth one and I gotta stop here’s the fifth thing that he did that was right that you gotta do he discovered the blessing in the middle of the bed one of the things that happens when you stop flapping your wings and you stop trying to make things happen and you stop pretending like you are God and like you are so in control of your own life as you get blessed beyond measure God took them from the valley of the battle over to the valley of baracan that means the valley of blessing from the valley of the battle to the valley of the blessing God wants to give you so much that you have to share it with other people just imagine that just imagine that for a minute don’t let that go over your head Ino out your ear can you imagine God flipping the script in your life in a 24-hour period I’ve read you the Bible today I this is not my story this is God’s story this is what I’m telling you he flipped that script they got the prophetic word they went to sleep they got some rest then they got up and they got the victory they went from being overwhelmed by the burden to overloaded by the blessing and let me tell you somethin verse 27 can you pull up verse 27 for me in verse 27 the Bible said they were then they returned every man of Judah and Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat in front of them to go back to Jerusalem with joy for the Lord had made them rejoice over their enemies in other words it wasn’t they themselves who got the victory this was hand given to them God did this for them you know there are some battles that when you win you’re so exhausted from the fight because there is a fight that I’m not to fight right out of you there’s some battle you win but you’re like I need time to recover before I can enjoy what I want not this time they got the spoils they went back home rejoicing what was the difference this battle was the Lord’s they didn’t earn it they didn’t fight for it they didn’t beg for it they didn’t buy it all they did was just receive it because when you do those five things y’all got all of them can we put them up just put them up on the screen real quick one two three four five one two three pray about it thank you he focused on God and not the problem he admitted his inability he thanked God in advance and he discovered the blessing in the bad y’all got that come on jump up on your feet all over the building just look at somebody and tell him I’m going after the blessing I’m going after the blessing I’ve had some tough times I’ve been in some tight places but it’s getting rid of shifts because I’m getting a focus on God I’m get rid of call on God and not my neighbor not my friend not my buddy not my mama not I put my daddy I’m getting a call out God and I’m gonna look at bad things and I’m most searched until I find the good things there were dead bodies everywhere they climbed over the bad days and they got the rings off that finger and they got the jewelry off their neck are y’all here at me be careful that you don’t throw away the bad cuz your blessing might be right in the middle of it and sometimes you gotta be willing to say hmm this is a little weird but give me what belongs to me this is mine hear this I got a stop here this right here they didn’t come after the enemy when they got back to their land and realized they had been inhabiting that place God said don’t touch him because there’s a time there’s a time frame be careful what you try to uproot outside of the timing of God hello don’t stir up the devil if you can’t cast him out all that means is you gotta get before God and you got to hear him more clearly but if you will all this overwhelm stuff I want every person that’s been feeling overwhelmed to lift both of your hands right now in this building Father in the name of Jesus I see hands all over this building today I believe that we’ve given you our people this word we’re gonna stand on your word if it worked for Jehoshaphat if it works for Judah it’s gonna work for our us if it worked for their house it’s gonna work for our house so Lord today we just surrender everything to you Lord we lay it all down right here in this room we asked you God for help we admit that we can do it by ourselves we absolutely need you in our lives we praise you in advance for what you’re gonna do we love you we trust you we rest in you and we promised God that we’re not just gonna discount things because they look bad but Lord we’re gonna look into the band and we’re gonna see the blessing that you have appropriated for us well you have blessings put in crazy places but that’s all right God cuz we’re going from being overwhelmed by the battle to being all God to being blessed to living in the valley of the blessing I want everybody to get something I do this periodically because I want to remind you of this I want you to get something in your hand that’s heavy that you don’t mind losing for a moment please don’t grab your iPad or your iPhone because then you’re gonna come back and ask me to pay for it and I’m not paying for it I have a parking lot to pay for that’s that’s my paper but I want you get something heavy get your Bible get your notebook put your wife down sir get something heavy and then move your move yourself a little bit and give yourself some space you’re like space I wish I couldn’t give [",0
