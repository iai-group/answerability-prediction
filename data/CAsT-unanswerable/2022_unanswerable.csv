Such droughts also impose costs in terms of wildfires, both in terms of control costs and lost timber and related resources.  Water users will eventually adapt to more frequent and severe droughts, in part by shifting limited water supplies towards higher-value uses.  Such shifts could be from low- to high-value crops, or from agricultural and industrial to environmental and municipal uses.  A period of delay is likely, however, because gradual changes in the frequency and severity of drought will be difficult to distinguish from normal inter-annual variations in precipitation.  Economic losses will be larger during this period of delay, as compared to a world with instantaneous adjustment, but preemptive adaptation could also be costly given the uncertainty surrounding future climate.  Rising surface temperatures are expected to increase the proportion of winter precipitation received as rain, with a declining proportion arriving in the form of snow.  Snow pack levels are also expected to form later in the winter, accumulate in smaller quantities, and melt earlier in the season, leading to reduced summer flows."

The report says that climate scientists are 95 percent certain that 'human influence has been the dominant cause” of global warming since 1950.  They also warn of large rises in sea level if humanity doesn't act aggressively to curtail its fossil-fuel emissions and other greenhouse gases.  Yet, in some ways, what's most striking is how little the report alters our broad understanding of global warming.  This is, after all, the fifth assessment report that the IPCC has put out since 1990.  And the main message hasn't shifted all that radically over the last 25 years.  Yes, there have been new advances in key areas, from climate history to predicting the effects of sea-level rise.  But the core point — that humans are heating up the planet significantly — has stayed remarkably consistent over the past quarter-century."
464,132_2-1,0,KILT_5042951-2,0,"Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century, the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further in a moderate scenario, or as much as in an extreme scenario, depending on the rate of future greenhouse gas emissions and on climate feedback effects. These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing.   Effects of global warming include rising sea levels, regional changes in precipitation, more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, and expansion of deserts.  Surface temperature increases are greatest in the Arctic, with the continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice.  Overall, higher temperatures bring more rain and snowfall, but for some regions droughts and wildfires increase instead.  Climate change threatens to diminish crop yields, harming food security, and rising sea levels may flood costal infrastructure and eventually force the abandonment of many coastal cities.  Environmental impacts include the extinction or relocation of many species as their ecosystems change, most immediately the environments of coral reefs, mountains, and the Arctic.  Because the climate system has a large 'inertia' and greenhouse gases persist in the atmosphere, climatic changes and their effects will intensify for many centuries even if further greenhouse emissions stop."
510,132_2-1,0,MARCO_15_1835420465-2,0,"Over a forest canopy or a vast expanse of grassland, large amounts of  transpiration can markedly increase water vapor in the atmosphere, causing more  precipitation and cloud cover in an area. The additional cloud cover often  reinforces the cooling by blocking sunlight.     Because of these processes, many researchers believe plants may have a  sizable impact on global climate in the future.  As humans continue to generate  carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, the Earth’s surface will likely  warm at a faster rate than it has in a thousand years.  According to the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Earth is likely to warm  another 1.4 degrees to 5.8 degrees by the end of this century (IPCC 2001).   Needless to say, such big changes in the climate would likely alter vegetation  growth all over the world.  Many researchers hypothesize that the changes in  vegetation could either serve to worsen or put a damper on global warming.  If,  for instance, the increased temperature and carbon dioxide levels of the Earth  cause vegetation worldwide to flourish, plants could draw down more carbon  dioxide and thus reduce the impact of the greenhouse effect."

This figure shows the mean annual air temperature from 1815 to date as recorded at the Radcliffe Meteorological Station.  Two interesting facts are apparent from the Radcliffe temperature time series: In the 20th century temperatures were generally higher than in the 19th century.  This is thought to be an effect of the urban heat island.  With the development of the city, more open spaces were built up.  This process produced radical changes in the nature of the surface and atmospheric properties of the city.  Differences in surface materials, drainage characteristics, sources of heat, configuration of surfaces and pollution acted to change all aspects of the climate of the city, air temperature being affected particularly strongly.  Urban heat island effect is the most common example of inadvertent climatic modification.  The post-1986 decade was the warmest decade on record.  This fact may be an effect of the interannual climatic variability, or it may be suggestive of climate change.  Only time will tell!

The economic, political and technology choices thus have a more important bearing on climate change than “over population.”  Back to top Pollution For Others Pollution and emissions are related to consumption, not just population numbers alone.  While pollution is increasing in poorer countries as well, it is not solely due to rising populations, because, as the U.N. points out, and as mentioned earlier, 80% of the world’s resources are consumed by the world’s wealthiest 20%.  Hence, even if pollution is occurring in poor countries, a large portion of it is to meet this consumer demand.

That the current trading system encourages companies to sell carbon emissions allowances they would not normally use.  Meaning that wealthy companies that go over their allowance find it fairly easy and economical to pollute more if they choose to.  The point of this argument is that the current trading system does not work.  Wealthy companies will just buy more carbon credits and ignore their quota.  So, wouldn’t a different system be better?

The message was clear: The United States — once a world leader that sat at the front of the class — has relegated itself to the back of the room with the world’s perceived outliers.  Some commenters noted that even Uzbekistan, a onetime Paris holdout that is home to one of the worst ecological disasters on the planet, signed the climate agreement last month.  The problem with the comparison, and the implicit developed-world condescension it contains, is the glaring absence of context.  Syria didn’t sign the agreement because the country remains locked in a protracted civil war that the United Nations estimates may have displaced 12 million people and resulted in more than 250,000 deaths.  Meanwhile, Nicaraguan leaders said they declined to enter the Paris agreement not because they didn’t want to abide by new emissions standards but because those standards weren’t strict enough and didn’t require enough sacrifice from wealthier countries with larger economies, according to Reuters."

But by rolling back the policies needed to meet American commitments, the United States essentially announced that it would not comply, whether the nation remains a signatory or not, experts said.  “One of the greatest concerns is what other key countries, including China, India and Brazil, will do when the U.S. reneges on the Paris agreement,” said Robert Stavins, a professor of environmental economics at Harvard, mentioning some of the world’s other largest carbon dioxide polluters.  “The worst-case scenario is that the Paris agreement will unravel,” Mr. Stavins said.  “That would be a great tragedy.”  Diplomats from some of the world’s other major economies say they intend to continue carrying out their climate change agreements, with or without the United States.  But the Trump administration’s moves are likely to embolden opponents of climate action around the world.  At the heart of the Paris accord was a breakthrough 2014 agreement between Mr. Obama and China’s president, Xi Jinping, in which the leaders of the world’s two largest polluting countries agreed to enact policies to cut their emissions.  At the time, Mr. Obama offered the Clean Power Plan as evidence that the United States would meet its target."

The year started out on a potentially ominous note due to the turmoil surrounding the Big 12 Conference after it lost its third member in two years (by the end of the year, it would lose a fourth member) and the real potential for the conference to disband.  Baylor was not being considered by any major conference as a potential member due to its poor overall football performance as a Big 12 member (the 2010 season was the first year that the program finished at .500 in conference play, and only the second time that it had not finished last or tied for last in its division).   But the Year of the Bear would start with an upset when the Baylor Bears football team defeated former Southwest Conference rival (and later Big 12 rival) TCU (which was coming off an undefeated season and No. 2 ranking the prior year) 50–48.

This agreement is similar to the Kyoto Protocol, except that each country’s acceptance and participation is not mandatory.  Also, each country will commit to report their changes.  The agreement is on a goodwill basis and assumes that each country will live up to their part in saving the climate by reducing greenhouse gases.  180 Countries Pledged their Support On December 18, 2009, it was signed into agreement with more than 180 countries pledging their support.  If all of the countries who have signed the contract to date were to live up to their end of the bargain, the greenhouse gas levels would be significantly reduced.  Consequently, a reduction in greenhouse gases, which are responsible for the greenhouse effect would slow down global warming which contributes to several catastrophic disasters including heat waves, droughts, hurricanes, and desertification among many others.  A Different Approach Since this contract is not legally binding, it is expected that  many countries who were not part of the Kyoto Protocol will sign the agreement as they are now without worry of legal ramifications if they do not reach their targets."

Trump's withdrawal from the Paris agreement will impact other countries by reducing its financial aid to the Green Climate fund.  The termination of the $3 billion U.S. funding will ultimately impact climate change research and decrease society's chance of reaching the Paris Agreement goals, as well as omit U.S. contributions to the future IPCC reports.  Trump's decision will also affect the carbon emission space as well as the carbon price.  The U.S.'s withdrawal will also mean that the spot to take over the global climate regime will be obtainable for China and the EU.  Following the 2020 presidential election, President-elect Joe Biden vowed to rejoin the Paris Agreement on his first day in office.

There will be a celebratory mood.  China, Japan and South Korea have offered big new “net zero” pledges.  Europe is racing to finalize an even more ambitious target in advance of this week’s summit, and, following the November election, the United States appears poised to follow suit.  If these countries follow through — a big “if” — these moves could put the world within a hair of reaching the Paris agreement’s goals.  Does this mean the treaty is working?  As the Paris agreement hits the five-year mark, my research on the concept of “catalytic cooperation” can help us understand both how it survived President Trump and what might happen next.  The Paris agreement proved surprisingly resilient Withdrawing from the Paris agreement was among Trump’s 2016 campaign promises.  His unexpected electoral victory took place during the 2016 U.N. “Conference of the Parties” (COP22), leading many of the delegates gathered in Marrakesh, Morocco, to fear the agreement might collapse if Trump forced the United States, a major party, to walk away."

This will make the US the only country to pull out of the agreement.  President Trump has expressed doubts in the veracity of climate change evidence and repercussions.  He has also voiced his opinion that the conditions of the agreement are unduly harsh on the US to the benefit of other industrialized countries, specifically China.  Criticism of this move has been harsh from both Trumps’ own party, the Republican Party, as well as the opposing Democrats.  Although Trump wishes to exit the treaty to avoid certain clauses, he has declared the intention to remain at the table for climate change talks on the global level.  America’s stance on the Paris Climate Change Agreement is likely to shift if Trump is not successful in his re-election bid, and the Democrats have publicly announced that they will recommit to the treaty immediately if their candidate is elected to the Oval Office.

He is unlikely to succeed.  But if he did, the United States’ 232-year history as a democracy would be finished.  Now is a time of testing: Do you stand with the democrats or the autocrats?  Unfortunately, most Republicans are failing this test — just as they have failed every other test during Trump’s presidency.  According to Axios, only six Republican senators (out of 53), seven Republican governors (out of 26) and 10 Republican members of the House (out of 197) have thus far acknowledged that Joe Biden won.  That means fewer than 1 in 10 of the most senior elected Republicans publicly stands behind our electoral system.  Even fewer have followed Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) in warning that Trump’s unfounded claim of election-rigging “damages the cause of freedom.”  Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) has often championed freedom abroad, but now he is a threat to freedom at home.

In a statement, former vice president Al Gore pointed out that if a Democrat wins the White House, the United States could reenter the accord.  “Despite the president’s best efforts, the U.S. cannot officially withdraw from the Paris agreement until one day after next year’s presidential election.  And even if he follows through, it would take just 30 days for a new president to get us back in.  This decision is ultimately in the hands of the voters,” Gore said.  2020 candidates weigh in: Numerous candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination were quick to criticize the administration and use the moment to emphasize their climate policies.  Former vice president Joe Biden called the administration’s move “shameful.”  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called Trump an “international embarrassment” and pledged to rejoin the deal, as did Sen.

Take the second piece of the 13-gallon trash bag and position it across the sheet, under your lower back and beneath the area of your abdomen.  Lie down on your back on the plastic bag.  Place the saturated pack on your abdomen, with the oiled flannel against your skin and the plastic-covered heating pad on top.  Adjust the heating pad control to the warmest setting you can tolerate comfortably.  It should be very warm ('as hot as the body can stand'), but not so hot it burns you.  And please note that it's easy to fall asleep with the pack in place so if you find that happening, be doubly careful of the temperature setting on your heating pad and lower it if necessary."

So stay away from mind games and start practicing how to be more straightforward.  If you want to say something, go direct to the point because that’s what he appreciates.  Flowery words will just ruin the conversation.  And oh, about playing mind games with your friends when he’s around?  That’s a no-no too.  3 Appreciates Being Pampered But Doesn't Pay It Forward Favim Yes, we get it.  This doesn’t sound right.  But what can we do?  This is how most Virgos are.  We really can’t change them, right?  If you’ve never been with a Virgo, it may come as a shock to you that they are not huge fans of pampering you.  They’re not cold or something, they just don’t like pampering their partners much, which sounds weird but true.  But on the flip side, they do want to be pampered.  They like it a lot and they appreciate it.  And because they are natural Virgos, they will tell their girls that they do appreciate being pampered."

One of the easiest things you can do to feel great is get some rest.  If you only have a little time to pamper yourself, get comfortable and take a nap.  If you're setting aside a day of pampering, plan on going to bed early or sleeping in so you can get 7 to 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep.  To help you fall asleep, dim the lights in your room and stay away from bright screens.  Avoid drinking caffeine or alcohol before going to bed."

While making your very first robot your goals should be to just learn all the basics: how to program, how to use the tools, terminology, learn basic technology, and how to get robot parts super cheap.  Save that cool robot idea you have for your second robot.  You can always scrap the first for parts to build the second later.  Trust me .  Ok I am ready, what do I need to start ?  Obviously the first is MONEY.  Robots can get expensive.  A skilled roboticist can build a robot for next to nothing ($50, for example).  He would often have collected enough stuff over the years that he would not have to go and buy most parts.  He also would know how to build his parts instead of buying them pre-made, as well as have the skills to improvise.  However the beginner does not have these options.  You can make most of your robot out of parts in your house, but don't expect to make your first robot McGyver style with just rubber bands and toothpicks.

Dead Sea salt also will work to soften skin, whereas sea salt can be drying.  Sugar is a milder alternative to salt and works well for older or sensitive skin.  Coffee is a gentle exfoliation alternative as well, and some evidence suggests that it may help smooth cellulite-ridden skin.

5484,133_3-2,0,MARCO_44_2001302180-2,0,Diagnosing Parkinson's disease Managing Parkinson's disease with medications Managing Parkinson's disease with surgery Next lesson Multiple sclerosis Video transcript so in most people right when we're talking about their Parkinson's disease we say that their Parkinson's disease is idiopathic and that just means that we don't know what caused it and that's actually the case for the vast majority of people with Parkinson's disease about eighty-five percent of people so it's a lot right but in a handful of people with Parkinson's disease about 15% we actually do know what caused the disease and for these people something's actually gone wrong with at least one of their genes so a quick recap on genes remember that genes are essentially specific segments of our DNA right so you'd find them in almost every cell in your body so there are specific segments of DNA that provide instructions to the cell and each gene is like a special recipe so each gene has instructions for how to make different proteins and once these proteins are made they go off and they do tons of different tasks tons of different important tasks all around our bodies like well basically everything basically everything is done by proteins from creating our cellular structure to our organs to our enzymes those are proteins to essentially every structure or process in our bodies that you can even think of absolutely everything somehow involves proteins so when something goes wrong with our genes let's say it's supposed to look like this right but maybe due to a mutation a change in that gene it ends up actually looking kind of different so maybe something like this here now all of a sudden the instructions the recipe that that gene has for making their proteins they're not correct anymore right they're not the same and so the proteins that should be made the proteins that we want these genes to make now they can't be made properly anymore at least in cells that have these genes that are affected that are changed that are mutated and when proteins are made properly well they won't be able to carry out their normal roles anymore right so we actually have a collection of genes a family of genes that when they're changed when they're mutated in some 'we can either directly cause or increase our chance of developing Parkinson's disease and this depends on on which gene gets mutated now remember how we get our DNA how we get our chromosomes so we have 23 single chromosomes that we get from our dad and we get another 23 single chromosomes from our mom and they form pairs so we end up with 23 pairs of chromosomes right so that means that we have two copies of each gene right one copy came from your mom and one copy came from your dad now let's actually classify genetic causes of Parkinson's disease into two groups so two types of inheritance if you will so we'll say autosomal dominant over here and and we'll say autosomal recessive over here on this side and this will all start to make sense in a minute here and the inheritance patterns can get really detailed and messy so I'm not going to really go into all of that at the moment but basically I want to get across here that the autosomal dominant types of Parkinson's disease or really any other disease that's inherited in an autosomal dominant way you only really need one bad copy of the gene so either one bad copy from your mom or one bad copy from your dad and that would be enough to cause the disease so in this case in our case that's Parkinson's disease and autosomal recessive well that means that both mom and dad need to pass on to you a mutated copy of the gene and there's one other thing I should mention so so when we say that a gene mutation causes a disease so in this case we say a gene mutation causes Parkinson's disease we can either mean that it definitely causes the disease 100% so if you get the mutated copy or if it needs two copies of the gene you will definitely develop the disease or we can mean that getting the mutated copy or copies will increase your chance of developing the disease so those two things are a little different right and for some genes certain mutations within that gene will definitely cause the disease and other mutations in that gene may just increase the chance of a disease developing and that's because different mutations in Jeane affect the genes protein in different ways right so some mutations may be more detrimental than others so that can increase the chance of disease developing so as we're chatting about these these mutated genes that we're going to get to that are relevant to Parkinson's disease we're just going to say that they can cause the disease but in the back of our minds we just have to remember that depending on which specific mutation in the gene is happening because there can be quite a few different ones in one gene and this is still being researched right the mutation can either 100% cause the disease or just increase the chances of developing the disease okay so there are five main genes that we know about so there are a few more but there's five main ones that when they're mutated in some way can cause Parkinson's disease so we won't go into all of these genes but let's go over a few of the genes that are a bit more commonly mutated so let's head over here to our first chromosome chromosome number one so here's our first chromosome so it's just it's just hanging out here and and right about here we have a gene called Park seven and park seven it has instructions for making a protein called DJ one so here's DJ one here and and DJ one kind of makes me think of a mom when I think about what DJ one does I think if I think of a mom it does things like protecting and guiding right protecting and guiding our molecules around our body you know like how your mom protects and guides you right so it helps protect ourselves it helps protect them during situations that stress ourselves out and and it helps guide our proteins so it helps guide them to do things like make sure they're folding in the correct three-dimensional shape because remember that our proteins are proteins need to get into a certain shape in order to be able to function properly right and dj1 also helps to make sure that damaged proteins proteins that we we don't want anymore are sent off to be broken down because otherwise they kind of pile up in our cells and they get in the way right now this last ones not very mom-like I'm sure none of our moms would send us off to be degraded but anyway so those are some of the main tasks of dj1 so some mutations in the gene park7 can cause Parkinson's disease park7 is one of those genes where you need to get a mutated copy from both your mom and your dad in order to develop Parkinson's disease so this would be considered an autosomal recessive cause of Parkinson's disease and it's actually responsible for early onset Parkinson's disease so so Parkinson's that's diagnosed before the age of 50 years old so when park7 is mutated when the genes DNA is changed in some way that changes the instructions on how to make the dj1 protein right because the gene carries our recipe for that protein so when this has changed dj1 isn't made properly and therefore it can't function properly it can't do all of these important mom-like tasks that we talked about so that's park7 and dj1 so what's our next gene let's let's jump over here to chromosome 6 and let's check out our next gene so about about here on chromosome 6 about here this is this is where our Park 2 gene is and for a mutation in this gene to cause Parkinson's disease it would need to be inherited in an autosomal recessive way as well a mutated copy from both your mom and your dad oh and something that's really interesting is that the park 2 gene it's one of the largest genes that we humans have in our whole body so it's one of the biggest genes that we have so park2 it encodes for a protein called Parkin so let's draw let's draw a little Park in protein here and Parkin has this really really important role what it does is it tags other proteins that are damaged or or that we have too many of there they're in excess and it tags them with this molecule called ubiquitin so ubiquitin is like a it's like a little flag it's a flag that alerts ourselves to shuttle these proteins that we don't want that we don't want anymore and it alerts them to shuttle them to these structures in our cells called proteasome and this is where those proteins that we don't want get broken down and disposed of so proteasomes are kind of like the the waste disposal facility in our cells so parking is really really important from making sure that we don't have all these excess or damaged proteins kind of piling up in ourselves and getting in the way so we actually know of a couple 100 different Park two mutations that can cause parkinson's disease so some of these mutations are associated with the juvenile form of Parkinson's disease which is essentially an extremely early onset type of Parkinson's disease relatively speaking to when it normally comes on so when people are diagnosed before the age of 20 and some other park2 mutations they're associated with late onset Parkinson's disease which is when people are diagnosed after the age of 50 years old but in either case whether it's early or late Parkinson's disease these mutations have changed the gene a bit right they've changed our instructions for making Parkin and so we end up with a non-functional Parkin protein a Parkin protein that just can't do what it needs to do it can't function properly it can't tag these damaged proteins so that we get rid of them so our last gene that we're going to look at is is over here on chromosome 12 so here's chromosome 12 here I'll just draw it out and the gene that we're interested in is the LR rk2 gene so I'm going to call it lark - it's just a little easier to say and and it sits about here so so lark - gives us the recipe to make the protein dard erin and dart erin helps us do things like turn our cells on and off so that we can control their activity and and send signals around the brain so that different cells can talk to each other and what's really interesting is lark - mutations are actually the most common gene mutation that is associated with Parkinson's disease so this is the gene that we normally see issues with in people that have a genetic form of the disease and with this particular gene people only need to get one mutated copy from either of their parents rather than both so this is an autosomal dominant genetic cause of Parkinson's disease and just like before when when our lark - gene gets mutated we end up with a malformed a damaged dard erin protein being formed right so it's being produced by transcription and translation but because we've damaged the lark - gene in some way the instructions are all wrong so the protein ends up being formed a little differently so it can't function properly in order to carry out its really important roles so we've gone through some of these gene mutations that can as Parkinson's disease but by now you must be wondering yeah I get that I get that Park seven and park two and lark two can get mutated and produce malformed proteins and then they can't do their jobs correctly etc etc but what does that have to do with Parkinson's disease how does that cause Parkinson's disease and that's an excellent question and and the answer as it stands right now is that we actually don't know we don't know how these genes getting mutated and these proteins being malformed we don't know how that actually leads to the disease we just know that we consistently see Parkinson's disease development in people with these gene mutations but we don't yet know kind of step by step how people with these mutations actually develop Parkinson's disease so for now we'll just have to stay tuned into the ongoing research efforts to find out more about this one Putting it all together - Pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease

Step Four: Combine the Oil Mixture and Water Mixture Together I know, oil and water don’t mix—except when they do, thanks to a blender!  Scoop the oil mixture into the basin of a blender.  Make sure to really scrape out as much of the mixture as you can.  Place the lid on the blender and then turn it on medium-high.  Slowly stream in the water mixture a little at a time as the blender runs.  The mixture will continue to thicken with the more water you add (I know, it’s counterintuitive).  Once all the water is added, the mixture should be thick enough that the blender struggles to blend it.  That’s when you know it’s ready.  Turn off the blender and voila, you have lotion!  Depending on the power of your blender, the mixture may have heated up during the emulsion process—which is no big deal, it just means that the mixture will thicken even more as it cools back down to room temperature.  Step Five: Store, Label, and Use Scoop your DIY lotion out of the blender and keep in airtight small jars.  I like these straight-sided four-ounce amber glass jars."

Planning also involves a decision concerning your target-marketing base.  It answers the question: Who will buy your new fragrance?  This concerns researching consumer trends in order to ascertain which demographics your fragrance will appeal to and in what product form.  For example, some consumers from older age groups might prefer sustainable simple scents with essential oils and natural bases, while a younger clientele might lean more towards celebrity-endorsed fragrances.  Research Clientele And Target Consumer Base A target market can be tricky to ascertain.  For example, the majority of men do not buy their own fragrances, and if they do, they mostly select one favored by their significant others.  Statistics indicate that women today buy 60 to 70% of all men’s fragrances (often to wear themselves).  Fragrance developers are actively seeking marketing solutions that will persuade men to acquire scent collections for different occasions (day, evening, work, play).  Deciding on your desired market place as quickly as possible will eliminate a great deal of unnecessary research."

Even if your skin is in great shape and does not need to be moisturized with lotion, try a body massage with scented lotion on the hands.  You can even get lotion that heats up during application to add sensory warmth to the parts of your body to which it is applied.  The feel of gentle softness on your skin rotating in firm, steady massage movements can remove stress, subdue pain, and enhance endorphins to make you feel great.  What a wonderful gift to present to someone who is feeling tired out and worn down!  6.  Soften the roughest parts of your body.  Do your legs dry out after shaving?  How about rough hands or toughened heels?  No matter your age or lifestyle, body lotion can do wonders to help you relax and appreciate the simple comforts of life.

Written by Grace Young in Scented Candles Having candles in the home is one of the best ways to liven up the atmosphere, create a cozy mood, and even add some scent.  But from unscented candles to candles that simply don’t smell of much, you sometimes feel like you have to add your own touch.  With that in mind, you may have thought of adding essential oils to your burning candles to make them smell stronger.  But is it a good idea, and will it work?  Let’s find out!  Adding pure essential oils to the pool of melted wax in a burning candle is safe, and a good way to create a stronger smell.  The essential oils will mix in with the wax and burn at the correct temperature, which will release a strong smell throughout the room.  But be careful, essential oils are flammable.  As an alternative, you could also put a couple of drops of candle fragrance oil into your candle, or even specks of scented wax cubes.  All of these ingredients work because they are meant to be used in candles."

Some ingredients to look for include carrier oils and essential oils.  Carrier oils, which come from seeds and nuts, moisturize the skin among other attributes.  Carrier oils include coconut oil, jojoba oil, and almond oil.  Essential oils, such as sandalwood, pine, and cedarwood, typically provide a lotion with its scent (usually subtle) while offering other benefits for skin health.  Shea butter and cocoa butter have moisturizing qualities and help to soften skin.  Fatty alcohols, meanwhile, stabilize a lotion’s ingredients while also acting as an emollient, i.e., skin softener.  Some ingredients to avoid include synthetic colors and fragrances.  They often contain ingredients that can cause skin irritation, particularly for men with sensitive skin.  Short-chain alcohols –sometimes referred to as “simple” alcohol – can irritate and even damage the skin.  Be wary of chemical names such as isopropyl, ethanol, and propanol, among many others.  Parabens, often found in mass-produced hand creams and lotions, act as a preservative but are linked to a variety of health problems, although there’s no definitive proof yet.  2"

Stick with a few scents from the same scent family such as florals or fruit.  Decide which essential oils will be your base note, middle note and top note.  The base note is the scent that is noticeable the longest after it has been on your skin.  The middle note also stays for an extended amount of time but not as long as the base note.  The high note is generally the most identifiable scent when you first apply it to your skin.  Making the Fragrance Add the base note oil to the measuring cup with the dropper.  Add the middle note oil to the measuring cup with a dropper.  Add the high note oil to the measuring cup.  If making perfume oil, these essential oils should only make up 10 percent of your overall mixture.  Add the carrier oil to make up the rest of the equated amount.

Get Some Perspective What happens in your body when you stop running?  There’s a decrease in blood volume and mitochondria (the power plants in our cells), plus your lactate threshold falls, says coach and exercise physiologist Susan Paul.  In general, the longer you have been training, the more quickly you’ll be able to get back into it after a layoff, she says.  So, in general, someone who has been running consistently for 15 years, then has a layoff of a year, will have an easier time returning to running than someone who has been running a year, then is off for a year.  Why is that?"

What will need tweaking and getting up to speed is building up strength in unused muscles, tendons and ligaments and basically getting your body re-used to running and training your brain to think positively.  If you have been away from running for years, you will probably have memories of your faster younger self.  That is a great motivator.  However be realistic and remember that even though in your mind you are young, your 40 year old plus self does not have the same body as your 20 year old self.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heat illness during practice or competition is a leading cause of death and disability among U.S. high school athletes.  As more people exercise in warm conditions, proper precautions must be taken.  © Thinkstock 2016 Heat-related illnesses are preventable.  Prevention begins with understanding the causes of heat illness, and making sure to stay cool and hydrated during hot weather.  In addition, knowing the signs of heat injury and being able to treat it immediately will reduce the number of severe cases.  Cause When we exercise, our bodies cool off by sweating.  As we perspire, we lose necessary body fluids.  If we do not replace these fluids, we become dehydrated.  This makes it difficult to sweat and cool down, which can result in a heat injury.  During regular exercise, 70 to 90 percent of the energy our bodies produce is released by heat.  Many factors can hinder heat release and perspiration.  These include: Environment."

However, this means that you are missing out on different types of running exercises that you can do that will mix things up while giving you great benefits.  So, here we run (pun intended) you through some alternate running exercises that you can try.  Try these different types of running workouts! 1.  Base Run In a base run, you run at your natural pace to build up aerobic capacity.  Base runs are what usually makes up the brunt of your running training and because it shouldn’t be too challenging, they can be done quite often.  2.  Progression Run A bit more difficult than the base run, this type of training means that you run at your natural pace but finish it at a faster rate.

Avoid long breaks in exercising or rebuilding the habit will take some effort.  This may be advice a little too late for some people.  But if you have an exercise habit going, don’t drop it at the first sign of trouble.  Reward Showing Up – Woody Allen once said that, “Half of life is showing up.”  I’d argue that 90% of making a habit is just making the effort to get there.  You can worry about your weight, amount of laps you run or the amount you can bench press later.  Commit for Thirty Days – Make a commitment to go every day (even just for 20 minutes) for one month.  This will solidify the exercise habit.  By making a commitment you also take pressure off yourself in the first weeks back of deciding whether to go.  Make it Fun – If you don’t enjoy yourself at the gym, it is going to be hard to keep it a habit."

Strength Training Exercises for COPD Resistance exercises like push-ups, squats, and weight lifting are the most effective ways to build body strength and muscle mass.  Many people enjoy strength training using weights and other equipment you can find at the gym, but you can also do effective strength training exercises with minimal equipment at home.  You can buy a small set of light free weights for lifting at home and choose exercises that use your own body weight as resistance to build strength.  If you have severe COPD symptoms or limited energy, there are a variety of chair exercises you can do that are designed specifically for people with limited strength and mobility.  Most doctors recommend doing strength training sessions at least three days a week in order to see an improvement in strength and muscle mass.  You should start slow, doing only as much as you can handle without feeling too breathless or fatigued.  You can add in extra muscle groups and repetitions as time goes on and your strength and endurance increases.  Just make sure you talk to your doctor before starting any new exercise routine, and don't be afraid to ask for advice, either."

According to American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), exercisers aiming to improve strength and power should perform exercises for 8-12 repetitions.  If you wish to improve muscular endurance, perform 10 -15 reps of each exercise using a lighter weight.  It is important to rest for 2-3 minutes in between weight lifting.

A weak core leads to compensatory movements, thus decreasing your forward propulsion.  A strong upper body is essential for guaranteeing an efficient transfer of energy from your body to your legs.  Without this, the proper arm technique cannot provide optimal support to your legs.  An efficient running form helps you run faster and expend less energy.  An additional benefit: well-developed abs and back muscles help protect your spine from the impact of running.  Thus, a strong core is essential for minimizing the risk of injury.  Upper body exercises for runners: Here is a list of exercises you can do to build upper body strength at home, without weights: Bodyweight biceps exercises and triceps exercises Core exercises for runners Dynamic plank variations Back exercises you can do at home Good to know: The best exercises for building up your stabilizing muscles (pelvic, abdominal, and back muscles) are complex total body exercises like Planks, Push-ups, and Burpees.

How Do You Make It Easier?  “Starting with a reverse lunge is easier to learn and execute, but still offers the same benefits of the forward lunge,” McClendon says.  Start by standing tall with both feet facing forward.  Take a big step back onto the ball of your right foot—keep the heel off the ground.  Bend both knees until the left thigh is parallel to the ground and the right knee is hovering just above the ground, legs forming 90-degree angles.  Push through the left heel to return to standing.  When you’re ready, add resistance by holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.  If you’re working out at home, you use a towel as shown to make the move more challenging.  What are the benefits of lunges?  Lunges help runners control the hips and strengthen the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and core—all muscle groups we rely on to run).  They also help identify weaknesses that can lead to running injuries, says McClendon.  McClendon recommends runners incorporate unilateral movements into their training one to two times per week."

When you are beginning a workout plan with the goal to lose weight most professionals recommend a slightly different plan than the one previously discussed.  In order to lose weight, your caloric output must be greater than your caloric intake.  Dieting is one way to reduce caloric intake; however, dieting and nutrition alone will not produce the effect of both weight loss and toned muscles.  When you diet alone you lose weight from both fat and muscle.  Reducing muscle size decreases metabolism which makes it harder to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight over the long term.  Therefore, you must always incorporate exercise into any weight loss plan.  When you wish to lose weight most doctors recommend at least 30 minutes a day of some form of cardio exercise five times per week or more.  This can be combined with a weight training regimen similar to the two times per week per muscle group routine discussed above.  When you combine weight training with cardio you increase muscle mass, which in turn, increases metabolism and helps you shed the pounds more quickly.

In this procedure, a stapling method is used to create a small pouch in the stomach, which can only hold a small amount of food.  The newly formed pouch is then attached to the small intestine, allowing food to bypass part of the small intestine, which is where most of the calorie absorption takes place.  Adjustable gastric band This procedure helps you achieve lasting results by limiting food intake, reducing appetite and slowing digestion.  Like a wristwatch, an inflatable silicone band is wrapped around the upper stomach to create a new, tiny pouch.  This stomach pouch limits and controls the amount of food you eat.  A small outlet is also created to slow the emptying process into the stomach and intestines.  As a result, you should feel full and be satisfied with smaller amounts of food, which leads to weight loss.  The band can be adjusted or removed, making this one of the only reversible weight loss procedures.  Sleeve gastrectomy In this commonly done procedure, a large amount of the stomach is removed."

When you run for longer than 60 minutes, stored muscle glycogen gets depleted.  2 ﻿ When stored glycogen stores are low, then the sugar in your blood and liver glycogen become more important.  1 ﻿ Fueling with carbohydrate foods and beverages during your longer runs will prevent you from running out of energy and help boost your performance.  Refueling during your long runs helps to replace essential glucose that is burned as fuel.  Many experts advise refueling with some form of carbohydrate during high endurance runs lasting longer than 60 minutes.  2 ﻿ How Much to Eat How much you should eat when running is also determined by a few different factors.  Your body size, the intensity of your run, and its duration affect how much you need to eat.

BUT I think this was a good break for me.  Give my body some time to repair from the wear and tear I had introduced it to.  But got back into running at week 27 after the ablation and pushed it from 5 mile at the beginning of the week to a 10 mile run at the end of the week.  I felt good."

While the ‘number of calories burned’ metric shouldn’t be the sole reason you pursue a workout or activity – moving your body, getting your heart pumping, and working your muscles is incredibly beneficial for both your physical and mental health and wellbeing – you likely still want to know you’re getting a little extra something out of that 30-minute sweat sesh.  And it doesn’t hurt to know you’ve already worked off the calories you plan to consume in pizza later.  RELATED:  Best Health and Fitness Apps You probably already know of some of the best calorie-burning activities, too.  Running, HIIT, and spinning all have a pretty solid reputation for revving up the body and expending energy.  But just because those are well-known options, it doesn’t mean they are the only ones."

It’d be 520 calories for a 155lbs person and 622 calories for an 185lbs person.  Note that these values are just basic averages.  There are lots of other relevant variables worth consideration.  Research demonstrates that participants burn higher amounts of calories when in a class environment.  That’s especially the case where instructors motivate them.  The energy and music in the room will play a considerable role to boost one’s calorie expenditure.  Styles of Indoor Cycling – Calorie Burn To burn a higher number of calories, you’d need to perform more intense workouts.  Your body ought to fuel a larger ‘engine’ to burn more calories.  The amount you’d burn at moderate intensity isn’t same as the amount you’d at vigorous intensity.  There are usually two styles of indoor cycling as explained below: Style-1: Moderate Speed This style requires that you pedal in a smooth speed that’s neither too fast nor too slow.  Holding this form of cycling for 30 minutes would enable you to burn 200-300 calories.  The number of calories burned is dependent on your weight.  If you’re heavy, you’ll lose more calories."

Stay conversational on all of your exercise sessions.  This means that you should be exerting yourself at a low enough level that you could talk.  It’s okay to take deep breaths between sentences, but you don’t want to “huff and puff” between every word.  As the runs get longer, be sure to keep your blood sugar boosted by eating an energy bar (or equivalent) about an hour before exercise.  Custom Jeff Galloway goodrs!

10422,135_3-3,0,MARCO_48_1064690690-6,0,"Overtime when you regularly do skiing, your heart health becomes better, your heart becomes stronger, and it pumps up blood more efficiently with a reduced heart rate. You reach your maximum heart rate while you do cross-country skiing.  Therefore, it is a great cardio workout.  For those who prefer going a bit less intense, they can control their cardio workout by going a little slower in the tracks.  It is all up to you – but no doubt outdoor workout during the winter (like skiing) is a lot better than your indoor gym.  Aerobic and Anaerobic Workout Skiing is a great aerobic as well as anaerobic sport as skiers use their momentum and bodyweight to ski.  The aerobic threshold is a relatively steady state of workout that you can perform for a longer duration of time without going out of breath.  Cross-country skiing lets you increase your aerobic threshold so that you can go for a longer duration.  The anaerobic threshold, on the other hand, is the point when your body switches from its aerobic metabolism to anaerobic one.  It is a great measure in endurance sports when you need to decide the intensity of your workout.  During intense skiing when your body cannot keep up with its energy demands, the anaerobic state kicks in."

According to their type, walking and running bicycles in nature, both are a different “form of exercise.”  Here you understand both terms and will acknowledge what burns more calories walking or biking.  Walking and biking are the best options for exercise as both help circulate and pump your blood flow.  On the other hand, the more walking intensity can make a more difference than cycling, reducing “pounds” of weight.  If you are walking over a super brisk wall at a “moderate pace” of 4mph, it’s more likely to reduce 350 calories per hour.  Instead of walking, if you are into a race running position, then approximately 500-600 “calories burns.”"

It is much more practical to use this number than the flight of stairs as the number of stairs in different flights may vary greatly.  On average, climbing a flight of 13 stairs takes about 8 seconds.  8 seconds = 8/60 of a minute = 0.13 minutes = 0.13/60 of an hour = 0.002222 hours.  Finally, you can calculate the answer: Calories burned = METS (4) x Weight (77kg) x Time (.00222 hours)= 0.68 calories.  So, you spend between 0.5 and one calorie while climbing one flight of stairs.  Doesn’t look a lot, but that’s just 8 seconds.  And it’s 4 times more than what you’d have burned by just sitting on your sofa scrolling through social media.  Shutterstock Does Running Stairs Help Burn Calories?  Burning more calories running rather than walking up the stairs should not come as a surprise.  Here’s a list outlining the number of calories burned running a flight of stairs, as well as some other similar activities (5): You burn 5 calories per minute by walking slowly upstairs.  You burn 11 calories per minute climbing stairs at a fast pace."

Do squats during commercial breaks while watching television.  Have a sit-up competition.  Buy a pedometer for each member of the family, and have a daily challenge to see who can take the most steps.  Visit the zoo, museum, or amusement park to get in plenty of walking.  Have a hula hoop contest.  Jump rope.  Make a pact that for every 10 minutes on the computer everyone has to run up and down the stairs 10 times.  Volunteer to walk the dogs at your local SPCA.  Go on a scavenger hunt.  Have a bike race around the block.  Choose gifts that make your child move such as balls, bicycles, skates, or kites.  Present a weekly fitness challenge for the whole family, and post it on the fridge.  Some examples include performing 10 jumping jacks every day, doing 10 squats every time you go to sit down, or jumping on one leg for as long as you can.  Keep a box in the trunk of your car that holds balls, jump ropes, and chalk.  That way you will be ready for an afternoon of fitness fun, whenever, and wherever you are."

Resistance training can help you tone up your chest and belly.  However, if you have some fat covering the muscle you need cardio too.  Push-ups and crunches will not spot reduce the fat that covers these areas, but combining a sound exercise plan with a healthy diet will.  Plan and Execute Set a schedule and stick to it if you want to tone your chest and belly.  Do cardio three to five days per week for at least 30 minutes.  Train at a moderate to high intensity with activities such as swimming, biking, running or even jump rope.  Train your chest and abs two or three times per week on nonconsecutive days.  Do two to three sets of eight to 12 reps for each exercise you choose, according to the American College of Sports Medicine.  For abdominal training, you may need to do as many as 20 reps, but if you can keep going past that, you should pick a more challenging exercise.

You may also find damage to the floor itself as dropped weights puncture and crack the floor boards.  This type of damage is not only dangerous, but extremely costly to fix.  Noise is also a big concern.  Anything we do on the second floor will be amplified in the room underneath us.  Drop a dumbbell on the floor upstairs and the people downstairs are going to think the house is falling down.  Take a run on the treadmill and it will sound like you are herding elephants.  You can mitigate some of that noise with rubber matts and proper flooring.  You can also choose machines like rowers or ellipticals which are typically quieter overall ( see my recommended cardio machines here ).  In the end, though, you’re gonna need to let the folks downstairs know what’s going on so they don’t panic.  There are several great steps you can take to quiet your home gym, but if it’s upstairs, you simply can’t eliminate all of it.

Kennedy to conduct a quiet, three-month investigation of his own as chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on Administrative Practices and Procedure. On the basis of Kennedy’s findings, the Democratic leadership of the Senate decided to hold hearings on Watergate.  The result was the creation of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, the Ervin Committee, through which the nation learned of the White House tapes the specific cause of the drive to impeach Nixon.  In the most significant ways, the Dahlberg article represents the chief contribution of The Washington Post in the course of the Watergate scandal.

During the investigation, White House aide Alexander Butterfield (1926–) revealed that Nixon had installed an audiotape system in the Oval Office, to secretly tape conversations with advisors for historical purposes.  Cox issued a subpoena, or court order, directing Nixon to give Cox some of the tapes.  Nixon responded by firing Cox.  Public outrage forced Nixon to appoint another prosecutor, Leon Jaworski (1905–1982), to continue the investigation.  On March 1, 1974, a grand jury charged U.S. attorney general John N. Mitchell (1913–1988) and six other officials from the Nixon administration with conspiracy to obstruct investigation of the Watergate burglary.  Nixon was named as one of the conspirators, but he was not charged as an accused criminal.  In April 1974, Jaworski issued a subpoena, again asking Nixon to produce tape recordings of Oval Office conversations.  Jaworski said he needed the tapes for the criminal trial of Mitchell and Nixon's other officials.  This time, Nixon asked the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia to quash, or strike down, the subpoena."

Hunt insisted they were looking for evidence that the DNC was receiving money from the North Vietnamese or Cuban governments.  Liddy has recently claimed the plan was to find information embarrassing to White House counsel John Dean.  Perhaps the most popular theory is that Nixon was worried that O'Brien knew about his financial dealings with billionaire tycoon Howard Hughes, for whom O'Brien served as a lobbyist in addition to his DNC duties.  A large loan from Hughes to Nixon's brother had become an issue in the 1960 presidential race (which Nixon lost narrowly), and when Nixon took office in 1969, Hughes reportedly gave him $100,000 (about $650,000 today) by way of the president's friend Charles 'Bebe' Rebozo, some of which, a 60 Minutes report alleged, went toward Nixon's house in Florida.  If that was in fact what the money was used for, it'd be natural for Nixon to fear what O'Brien could do with that knowledge.  There is no smoking gun indicating that Nixon ordered the break-in personally."

Howard Hunt, Jr., formerly of the CIA, was listed in two address books belonging to the arrested men, and that a check for $6.36 from Hunt to a local country club had been left behind in one of their hotel rooms at the Watergate. From those early moments on, I was part of a team that viewed from close-in the uncovering of what many have called the worst scandal in the nation’s history.  Week by week, the Watergate disclosures led nearer to Nixon, engulfing his closest associates.  On the first day in July, 1972, John N. Mitchell, who as attorney general had been the chief symbol of law and order in Nixon’s administration, resigned as chairman of the re-election committee because of the scandal.  A month before the presidential election, the Post reported that the Watergate bugging was only one incident in a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage waged against the Democrats by the Nixon forces."

Butterfield's revelation of the taping system transformed the Watergate investigation yet again. Special Prosecutor Cox immediately subpoenaed the tapes, as did the Senate, but Nixon refused to release them, citing his executive privilege as President of the United States, and ordered Cox to drop his subpoena.  Cox refused.  On February 6, 1974, the United States House of Representatives voted 410-4 to approve H.Res. 803, giving the Judiciary Committee authority to investigate impeachment charges against the President.  'Saturday Night Massacre' Main article: Saturday Night Massacre When Cox refused to drop his subpoena, on October 20, 1973, Nixon demanded the resignations of Attorney General Richardson and his deputy William Ruckelshaus for refusing to fire the special prosecutor.  Nixon's search for someone in the Justice Department willing to fire Cox ended with the Solicitor General Robert Bork.  Though Bork claims to believe Nixon's order to be valid and appropriate, he considered resigning to avoid being 'perceived as a man who did the President's bidding to save my job.'"

In short, the TV hearings are coming at the end of a substantial investigative process, not the beginning.  That difference, combined with the deeper polarization of American politics and media, makes it unlikely, barring a true bombshell, that the hearings will significantly move public opinion.  To be sure, Nixon had further to fall than Trump does.  He entered his second term in a far stronger position than Trump entered his first: Nixon won every state except Massachusetts and boasted an impressive 62 percent approval rating in November 1972, according to Gallup.

After the five burglars were caught and the conspiracy was discovered—chiefly through the work of a few journalists, Congressional staffers and an election-finance watchdog official—Watergate was investigated by the United States Congress.  Meanwhile, Nixon's administration resisted its probes, which led to a constitutional crisis.   The term 'Watergate', by metonymy, has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration.  Those activities included such dirty tricks as bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious.  Nixon and his close aides also ordered investigations of activist groups and political figures, using the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as political weapons."

One of the men arrested in the break-in of the Democratic National Headquarters, James McCord, was a “security consultant” for the Central Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.) and “security coordinator” for the “Committee to Re-elect the President” meaning Nixon.  As later revealed, Watergate was only part of a vast array of break-ins, wiretaps, and sabotage connected to Nixon.  58 Nixon’s rationalization of the Watergate burglary was that this type of political behavior was not unique to him, except that he got caught.  In fact, in his first congressional campaign, all of his pamphlets were stolen in a break-in at Republican Party Headquarters in California.  The pamphlets, costing $3,000, had been purchased with money received from his wife’s sale of a piece of land.  59 Was Nixon’s conduct in political office pretty much standard or was it significantly different and unethical?  Does gaining and maintaining public office in America often involve unethical behavior?"

After the Slovaks issued their Declaration of Independence, he resigned as President on 20 July, saying that he would not preside over the country's breakup.   However, when the Czech Republic was created as one of two successor states, he stood for election as its first president on 26 January 1993, and won.  Although he was nominally the new country's chief executive, the framers of the Constitution of the Czech Republic intended to vest most of the real power in the prime minister.  However, owing to his prestige, he still commanded great moral authority, and the presidency acquired a greater role than the framers intended.  For instance, largely due to his influence, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), successor to the KSC's branch in the Czech Lands, was kept on the margins for most of his presidency.  Havel suspected that the KSCM was still an unreformed Stalinist party.   Havel's popularity abroad surpassed his popularity at home, and he was often the object of controversy and criticism."

In fact, it was his concern with those earlier transgressions that gave rise to a post-Watergate political axiom: that the cover-up of the crime can be more damaging than the crime itself.  Nixon's creation of a secret police organization without congressional authorization—one that carried out an illegal break-in without a warrant, no less— would ultimately become a basis for one of the articles of impeachment brought against him by the House Judiciary Committee.  As Howard Hunt would put it in an angry memo as his prosecution moved forward, 'The Watergate bugging is only one of a number of highly illegal conspiracies engaged in by one or more of the defendants at the behest of senior White House officials.  These as yet undisclosed crimes can be proved.'  Nixon's chief aide, Bob Haldeman, was caught on tape alluding to this very issue: Haldeman: The problem is that there are all kinds of other involvements and if they started a fishing thing on this they're going to start picking up other tracks."

Frank Wills, a security guard, discovered clues that former FBI and CIA agents broke into the offices of the Democratic Party and George McGovern months before the election.  These people listened to phone lines and secret papers were stolen.  When these men were found, it turned out that Nixon was involved and he had helped them cover it all up and might have even hired the men.  The Washington Post was a newspaper which played a big role in exposing the misdoings, specifically reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.  This showed the public that Nixon was not to be trusted, and society began to view him in a different light.  Nixon chose to resign from office on August 9, 1974 because he wished to not be impeached.  This means that he might have been charged with crimes.

In 1972, under the cloak of anonymity, the associate director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mark Felt, became a news source for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, political reporters at the Washington Post.  Felt provided information about a number of potential stories and was Woodward’s main source for information about President Richard Nixon’s involvement in a series of illegal activities, including the break-in at Democratic Party headquarters in Washington’s Watergate office complex.  The information eventually led to Nixon’s resignation and the indictment of sixty-nine people in his administration.  Felt was nicknamed “ Deep Throat ,” and the journalists kept his identity secret until 2005.  [  36] The practice of granting anonymity to sources is sometimes referred to as reporter’s privilege.  Fueled by the First Amendment’s protection of the press, journalists have long offered to keep sources confidential to protect them from government prosecution."

Because Peraino had used four wall distribution for all of Deep Throat's releases, that left the potential for the film to be classified as an unpublished work, preventing it from falling into the public domain.  Peraino sold the rights to the film to Arrow Productions for home video release (including a copyright notice) at some point prior to 2009.  Despite Arrow holding the rights, rival pornography distributor VCX began distributing Deep Throat as retaliation for Arrow's distribution of Debbie Does Dallas and The Devil in Miss Jones, two films VCX asserted were under their copyright.  (In the former case, Debbie Does Dallas was determined to be public domain in a 1987 court ruling.)  In order to prevent VCX from challenging the copyright on Deep Throat, Arrow Productions agreed in 2011 to voluntarily stop distributing Debbie Does Dallas and The Devil in Miss Jones, thus leaving their copyright status unresolved.  Television In April 1978, pirate station Lucky 7 in Syracuse, New York illegally aired Deep Throat (and also Behind the Green Door, as well as non-pornographic fare such as episodes of Star Trek ).

Felt never let Woodward or Bernstein quote him directly and at first only confirmed existing leads.  As the investigation unfolded, however, he offered some new information.  The moniker “Deep Throat” referred to a controversial but widely viewed pornographic film of the same name that was released in 1972.  VIDEO:  Richard Nixon’s Paranoia Leads to Watergate Scandal Richard Nixon’s personality and character issues may have led to his involvement in the Watergate scandal.  Nixon claimed it was just a ‘witch hunt.’  In October of that year, Watergate was finally linked to Nixon when the FBI determined the operation was a massive setup of spying and sabotage by Nixon’s aides to support his re-election.

I don't see anything wrong and I still don't.'  At the same hearing, Gandy claimed that she had destroyed Hoover's personal files only after receiving Gray's approval.  In a letter submitted to the committee in rebuttal of Gandy's testimony, Gray vehemently denied ever giving such permission.  Both Gandy's testimony and Gray's letter were included in the committee's final report.  In his memoir, Felt expressed mixed feelings about Gray.  He was the first person appointed as head of the FBI who had no experience in the agency, but he had experience in the Navy.  While noting Gray did work hard, Felt was critical of how often he was away from FBI headquarters.  Gray lived in Stonington, Connecticut, and commuted to Washington.

In his memoir, Felt strongly defended Hoover and his tenure as Director; he condemned the criticisms of the Bureau made in the 1970s by the Church Committee and civil libertarians.  He also denounced the treatment of Bureau agents as criminals and said the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act of 1974 served only to interfere with government work and helped criminals.

Anthropic arguments FHI has studied include the doomsday argument, which claims that humanity is likely to go extinct soon because it is unlikely that one is observing a point in human history that is extremely early.  Instead, present-day humans are likely to be near the middle of the distribution of humans that will ever live.  Bostrom has also popularized the simulation argument, which suggests that if we're likely to avoid existential risks, humanity and the world around are not unlikely to be a simulation.   A recurring theme in FHI's research is the Fermi paradox, the surprising absence of observable alien civilizations.  Robin Hanson has argued that there must be a 'Great Filter' preventing space colonization to account for the paradox.

Now 40 years later we have photorealistic, 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it’s getting better every year.  And soon virtual reality will be followed by augmented reality.  If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then soon the games will become indistinguishable from reality, just indistinguishable, and because we will not be able to distinguish real from unreal, It would seem to follow that the odds that we’re in ‘base reality’ is one in billions.  We are seeing rapid progress in computer science, including the development of quantum computers, whose vastly increased potential capacity would be vital for a large-scale simulation.  At the same time there is continued progress in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, biotechnology and other areas that would help create more convincing simulations.  And we can see that with each new breakthrough in technology, we tend to make better, more convincing representations of the world, both now and in the past.

The aliens (not to mention our descendants) all self-destruct before developing the compute power that would allow ancestor simulations.  If this is the way of things, then maybe you’re real.  But you’ll also have to expect an imminent end to human society.  Sell your real estate.  (2) A second possibility: Maybe lots of societies do develop the ability to make simulations, but for some weird reason, they don’t.  They’re not interested.  They’re never interested.  Personally, I find this hypothesis harder to swallow than a cookie with thumb tacks.  The alternatives to simulation don’t sound very convincing.  Bostrom’s hypothesis is unsettling.  It also prompts a few obvious questions: To begin with, is there any way to know whether life is real or fake?  Silas Beane, a physicist at the University of Washington, has considered how a careful study of cosmic rays might tell us if a computational grid underlies our perceived experience.  Such a grid is used by virtually all computer modelers, and serves to break down phenomenon into discrete chunks."

So if the virtual minds of an ancestor simulation are vastly more common than the original living minds that created the simulation, and if the simulated experience is completely consistent with our own experience, then it is more likely that we are those typical observers, statistically speaking.  Bostrom also states that the chances that we are a simulation is less than 50%.  This is due to the fact that a civilization is just as likely to die out before they have a chance to create such advancements, or an advanced civilization would just as likely choose to not make these types of simulations.  Also, there are no experiments that can be done to disprove this belief, making it unfalsifiable, which is a huge red flag.  This belief is really only popular for a few scientists and people who interested in such extraordinary beliefs, due to the fact that this belief goes against the vast majority of religions and there is no evidence of this belief."

He concludes that it is not only possible, but rather probable that we are living in a computer simulation.  This argument, originally published in 2001, shook up the field of philosophical ontology, and forced the philosophical community to rethink the way it conceptualizes “natural” laws and our own intuitions regarding our existence.  Is it possible that all of our ideas about the world in which we live are false, and are simply the result of our own desire to believe that we are “real”?  Even more troubling, if we are living in a computer simulation, is it possible that the simulation might be shut off at any moment?  In this paper, I plan to do two things.  First, I hope to consider what conclusions we might draw from Bostrom’s argument, and what implications this might have for how we affect our lives.  Second, I plan to discuss a possible objection to Bostrom’s argument, and how this might affect our personal probability for the possibility that we are living in a computer simulation."

By reviewing the probability assignments that Bostrom has just given, it becomes clear that several things have to be the case.  Because the number of simulations run by a civilization capable of running them would be very great, if simulations are done, then the number of people that are simulated would be much greater than the number of people that are not simulated, which would mean that the probability that we are living in a simulated universe is almost unity.  So, it becomes clear that one of two things must be the case.  Either the probability that simulations are run is very small (practically null), or it is almost certain that we ourselves are living in a simulation.  Bostrom asserts that, because we have no reason to believe that either of these possibilities is more likely than the other, we have no reason to change the way we live our lives because of this argument.  However, this isn’t quite accurate."

Here’s Andrew Zimmerman Jones, writing for The Nature of Reality : In 2003, philosopher Nick Bostrom of the University of Oxford made the first rigorous exploration of the simulation argument.  The simulations he considered are different from those in movies like “The Matrix,” in which the world is simulated but the conscious minds are not—that is, where biological human beings with human brains interface with the simulated world.  In Bostrom’s simulations, human consciousness is just another figment of the simulation.  Bostrom assumes that the human mind is substrate-independent: that human consciousness isn’t strictly dependent on the biological brain itself, and that if we could physically replicate that brain in sufficient detail in another form (such as within a computer) it would also have the subjective experience of consciousness.  The replication doesn’t have to be perfect.  It just has to be good enough that the replicated being has a human-like subjective experience (a “mind”).  An advanced civilization with sufficient computing power to pull this off would be classified as “posthuman.”"

However, there might be good reasons for thinking that we actually live in a computer simulation (Bostrom 2003), and if we lend some credence to radical skeptical scenarios, this may have consequences for how we act  (Schwitzgebel 2017).  Even purely hypothetical skeptical scenarios may enhance their psychological force by capitalizing on the analogy with dreams.  Clark  (2005) argues that the Matrix contains elements of “industrial-strength deception” in which both sensory experience and intellectual functioning are exactly the same as in standard wake-states, whereas other aspects are more similar to the compromised reasoning and bizarre shifts that are the hallmark of dreams.  1.4 Descartes’ solution to the dream problem and real-world dreams At the end of the Sixth Meditation, Descartes suggests a solution to the dream problem that is tied to a reassessment of what it is like to dream.  Contrary to his remarks in the First Meditation, he notes that dreams are only rarely connected to waking memories and are often discontinuous, as when dream characters suddenly appear or disappear."

Some philosophers disagree, proposing that perhaps 'Sims' do not have conscious experiences the same way that unsimulated humans do, or that it can otherwise be self-evident to a human that they are a human rather than a Sim.  Philosopher Barry Dainton modifies Bostrom's trilemma by substituting 'neural ancestor simulations' (ranging from literal brains in a vat, to far-future humans with induced high-fidelity hallucinations that they are their own distant ancestors) for Bostrom's 'ancestor simulations', on the grounds that every philosophical school of thought can agree that sufficiently high-tech neural ancestor simulation experiences would be indistinguishable from non-simulated experiences.  Even if high-fidelity computer Sims are never conscious, Dainton's reasoning leads to the following conclusion: either the fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage and are able and willing to run large numbers of neural ancestor simulations is close to zero, or we are in some kind of (possibly neural) ancestor simulation."

If one assumes first that humans will not be destroyed nor destroy themselves before developing such a technology, and that human descendants will have no overriding legal restrictions or moral compunctions against simulating biospheres or their own historical biosphere, then, Bostrom argues, it would be unreasonable to count ourselves among the small minority of genuine organisms who, sooner or later, will be vastly outnumbered by artificial simulations.   Epistemologically, it is not impossible to tell whether we are living in a simulation.  For example, Bostrom suggests that a window could 'pop up' saying: 'You are living in a simulation.

Bostrom’s position owes nothing to skepticism, he is concerned solely with the question of whether virtual humans are empirically possible and, if so, how likely it is that we might be such beings.

Following her Golden Globes speech, the actress — nominated for her 20th Oscar for her lead performance in Florence Foster Jenkins — was called ' highly overrated ' by Trump, which prompted Kimmel to make his own jokes about the actress.  Streep ultimately received a standing ovation from the Oscar crowd for the unprecedented amount of Academy Award nominations she's received throughout her career.  'We're also here to honor the actors who seem great, but actually really aren't,' Kimmel joked.  'And of all the 'great actors' here in Hollywood, one in particular has stood the test of time for her many uninspiring and overrated performances.'

In recent years, scientists have become interested in testing the theory.  In 2012, inspired by Professor Bostrom’s work, physicists at the University of Washington proposed an empirical experiment of the simulation hypothesis.  The details are complex, but the basic idea is simple: Some of today’s computer simulations of our cosmos produce distinctive anomalies — for example, there are telltale glitches in the behavior of simulated cosmic rays.  By taking a closer look at the cosmic rays in our universe, the physicists suggested, we might detect comparable anomalies, providing evidence that we live in a simulation.  Similar experiments were proposed in 2017 and 2018.  Professor Smoot captured the promise of these proposals when he declared, “You are a simulation and physics can prove it.”  So far, none of these experiments has been conducted, and I hope they never will be.  Indeed, I am writing to warn that conducting these experiments could be a catastrophically bad idea — one that could cause the annihilation of our universe.  Think of it this way.

Some children who are shy go on to develop anxiety.  So if your child’s shy behaviour is significant and hard to change, it could help to talk to a professional like your GP, paediatrician or a psychologist.  Shyness or something else?  It’s a good idea to talk to your child and family health nurse (for young babies and toddlers) or your child’s teacher (for preschoolers and school-age children) to consider other possible reasons for your child’s behaviour.  For example: A child with a language delay might show signs that she wants to speak to people – for example, looking for eye contact or trying to make social connections – but get frustrated that she can’t be understood.

Support calms a child.  For example, telling her, “Don’t worry.  You’ll do better next time,” encourages her, restores her belief in herself, and helps her to build optimism.  Children need a positive self-esteem.  It is in your eyes, your words, your actions, and your smile that your child forms an image of himself.  Children desperately want to feel that they are valuable.  Giving your child a good feeling about himself, by protecting his self-esteem, is one of your greatest challenges as a parent.  The goal in working with this issue is to communicate with him positively, which means choosing your words and actions carefully.  Here are some guidelines for positive communication: Avoid criticism, for instance, telling your child, “You’re kicking the ball all wrong.”  These words will deflate your child’s self-image.  Avoid comparisons.  If you say, “Why can’t you be more like your younger brother and get good grades?” your child will feel inadequate.  Avoid negative adjectives."

Explain to your teen that we all have a negative inner critic that drives our thoughts at times.  The inner critic isn’t the problem; it’s what we choose to do with those critical thoughts that matter.  Share a few thoughts that run through your mind when your inner critic is loud.  Talk about how you feel as a result of those thoughts.  Finally, share ways you reframe those negative thoughts to refocus on positive thinking.  Helping teens learn to accept their negative emotions, state their negative thoughts, and reframe their thinking gives them the tools to cope with future rejection and other stressful events.  When we normalize the process, teens internalize these skills and are better able to use them when rejection occurs.  Rejection is inevitable, even if you, as a parent, try to avoid it for your child.  Your child will face rejection, but if you help them by using these tools, and instilling them with their own coping mechanisms, they will be able to move on from rejection.

When interactions are unavoidable (going to a seldom-seen relative or friend’s house), give your son some scripts.  As child development psychologist Gordon Neufeld says, this is not a teaching tool as much as it is a workaround for your son’s shyness and immaturity.  As time does its work and your son matures, he will get better at meeting people.  Until then, you can follow a little script of your own: “Harry, we are going to Grandma’s house.  We don’t see her a lot, so let’s practice smiling.”  You walk out of the room and pretend to be Grandma and smile at Harry.  If he smiles back, awesome.  If he runs, no worries.

In response for the needs of children with autism, Romanczyk has suggested for adapting comprehensive model of social acquisitions with behavioral modification rather than specific responses tailored for social contexts.  Anxiety and Depression Individuals with few opportunities to socialize with others often struggle with social skills.  This can often create a downward spiral effect for people with mental illnesses like anxiety or depression.  Due to anxiety experienced from concerns with interpersonal evaluation and fear of negative reaction by others, surfeit expectations of failure or social rejection in socialization leads to avoiding or shutting down from social interactions.  Individuals who experience significant levels of social anxiety often struggle when communicating with others, and may have impaired abilities to demonstrate social cues and behaviors appropriately.  The use of social media can also cause anxiety and depression.  Internet is causing many problems, according to a study from the National library of Medicine, National institute of health, with a sample size of 3560 students.

Waiting Visual cues such as objects, pictures, and written words can provide concrete information to make the concept of waiting less abstract and more specific to the situation.  Visual timers are also a simple and effective way to help children understand the concept of waiting.  Taking turns: Turn-taking can be taught through the use of social stories and by using a picture or pictograph to cue your child.  You may also need to teach turn taking when it comes to activities, not just speaking.  You can practice this by playing games and activities that involve 2 or more players and require taking turns.  For example, the card game “Go Fish” requires you to take turns playing and speaking but it’s also is predictable – You ask for a card, if the other player has the card, they’ll give it to the other, if they don’t they will say “Go Fish”."

Let's be realistic, though: As digital natives, your children are going to be immersed in that world, so such a defensive posture is probably not going to be adequate in safeguarding your children against its ill effects on the formation of a healthy self-identity.  Here are some recommendations on how to develop your children's self-identity amid the cacophony of messages they're getting from media.  Inoculate Your Children Against Media's Messages You can help your children resist media's messages by priming them for those messages.  When you consistently offer your children contrasting perspectives, you prime them to stand firm against the unhealthy messages.  You can actively teach them 'executive functioning' skills, such as impulse control, critical thinking and long-term planning, that will further gird them against the unhealthy messages.  You can also help your children become sensitive to media's messages which will enable them to recognize those messages for what they are and see them with a healthy skepticism."

Instead, it’s about being confident in yourself no matter what others think about you.  One way to learn to accept yourself is to set positive, specific goals instead of trying to be like the unrealistic people you might see in the media.  This can be as simple as developing a mantra like 'I care more about what I think of myself than what others think about me.'"

I have to tell you, these print offers are truly fun when they take off like this.  It's wonderful, and very exciting.  I cannot thank everyone enough!  (I had to go through this post and edit out a whole bunch of exclamation points.)  One truly loyal reader ordered nine, and there have been many orders for more than one print.  'Black Friday' lived up to its name here at TOP World Headquarters—it has made my year!  (Sorry, there's another one.  Never write when you're happy, it makes you sound like an idiot.)  I can't wait to see how we've done at the 24-hour mark.  As you can guess, Ctein got hammered—he worked for fifteen hours straight with only small breaks before exhaustion set in.  Just before he turned in, however, he emailed me to report that everyone who ordered by his bedtime late last night has been sent an acknowledgement, and he processed all but the last two dozen orders that came in yesterday."

Pink: Adam Grant, [  the youngest tenured professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania] finished a study this summer.  The research shows extroverts are more likely to take sales jobs, extroverts are more likely to get hired, and extroverts are more likely to get promoted.  But if you look at the link between extroverts and sales performance, strong extroverts only did a little better than the strong introverts.  The classic glad-handing extroverts only did a little bit better than the introverts cowering in the corner.  The people who did best by far — and it is not even close — were the people in the middle.  Why are the extroverts not very good?  They don’t listen.  They are too pushy.  Why are [  the introverts] not very good.  They don’t assert.  They are quiet The people who in the middle, they have the best of both worlds.  They know when to talk.  They know when to listen.  They know when to push.  They know when to hold back.  They are much more attuned.  The good news is most people are ambiverts."
15973,139_1-5,0,KILT_538026-4,0,"First published in 1952, it stayed on the 'New York Times' bestseller list for 186 consecutive weeks, and according to the publisher, Simon and Schuster, the book has sold around 5 million copies. The fact that the book has sold 5 million copies is printed on the cover of the current edition in both paperback and hard cover, and directly contradicts exaggerated claims that the book has sold more than 20 million copies in 42 languages.  The publisher also contradicts the translation claim, saying the book has been translated into only 15 languages.  Nearly half of the sales of the book (2.1 mil.) occurred before 1958, and by 1963, the book had still only sold 2 million copies according to Peale.  Since then, the book has sold less than 3 million copies over the past 60 years.  Some of his other popular works include 'The Art of Living', 'A Guide to Confident Living', 'The Tough-Minded Optimist', and 'Inspiring Messages for Daily Living'.   In 1947 Peale co-founded (along with educator Kenneth Beebe)  The Horatio Alger Association.  This organization aims to recognize and honor Americans who have been successful in spite of difficult circumstances."

The industry was on a tear in 2015, running at or above a torrid sales pace of 18 million for much of the year.  The comeback of the US market has been stunning.  Sales plunged below 10 million in the depths of the Great Recession .  Back then, no one was sure if there would ever be anymore records broken.  Still, it could have been a better 2015.  Some analysts surveyed by Bloomberg — at consumer-auto information resources such as Kelley Blue Book, True Car, and Edmunds and at big investment banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan — thought the selling pace for December would pull the yearly total up close to 18 million.  And although everybody except Volkswagen, still reeling from its emissions-cheating scandal, notched gains, some car makers finished December a bit light against expectations.  At Ford, for example, US sales rose 8% in December to 239,242 vehicles.  Analysts expected an increase of 11%.  Also lighter than expected were sales from GM and Fiat Chrysler.  Ford and GM slipped in regular trading on Tuesday, down about 2% and 3%, respectively.  It got pretty bad."

the 700 club Posted by Cee Harmon Categories: Ministry Outreach TV Elevate Christian Network :: Ministry Outreach TV Jesus is love the Lord wants you in every respect of your life to prosper and be in health but it’s as here soul prospers and so that means he wants your soul to be whole he wants your mind your will your emotions your your faculties of passion in that just to be aligned with him and so today we have a guest that is an expert in this field it’s Katie Souza from expected and ministries and Katie you’ve been studying into this area of the soul and healing for the Soul for a long time now but not only studying you’ve actually been applying with your faith the redemptive power of Jesus Christ his healing blessing is his deliverance power and people are set free all over the world because of your ministry and so we’re just thrilled to have you with us today on the program and I know that you’ve got lots of good nuggets for us so let’s talk about the healing of the soul why is it important well for me it started out as necessity of getting this revelation because I was getting sick with all kinds of things reoccurring issues that would never go away at bladder infections yeast infections sore throats flus fevers and it seemed like I was doing what I’m supposed to do you know I was praying believing the crane and I wasn’t getting the breakthrough and so I knew there was something missing and I didn’t understand what it was and that’s when God began to you know speak to me through that scripture that will prosper and be in health even as our soul prospers and God began to show me how certain things like sin and trauma can wound our souls right you know isaiah 30:26 in the amplified talks about god healing up the brokenhearted and binding up their wounds that came from their sin right so saying that when we sin or when somebody sins against us or ancestors sin it can literally wound us okay and even like for trauma that traumas that we live through divorces losing jobs our children maybe someone passes away in our life those traumas can also wound our soul man you know and a good example of that and the Bible is job remember he went through a lot of trauma right he had all his servants killed and all his his wealth was stolen his children were all killed at the same time when a whirlwind you know crashed the house down on on them and then he himself even got sick physically well those traumas wounded his soul and we know that because throughout the entire book of Job 23 times he says stuff about his soul like I’m mourning and so on vexed and soul my soul is being poured out and it was always him making these statements in connection to the pain the soul pain he was feeling over those traumas and you know Katie if if your soul isn’t that much pain it’s going to affect your quality of life in the same way that if your body like has an injury like let’s say someone you know cut your your arm and you know your tendons are all damaged and everything else then that arms not going to function right and you’re not going to have quality of life so we can’t ignore this area of soul healing in the same way as we wouldn’t be able to ignore the need for a physical healing yeah and even doctors will say that when you live through a traumatic event or something has stressed you and your inner man they don’t even really necessarily call it my soul but they say that 80 to 90% of their patients that have a serious even a deadly illness right have suffered some sort of a event like that than traumatising to them so what happens in here directly affects everything out here including the physical body right and you know when as we go around teaching people how to get healed in their soul we see thousands and thousands of miracles I mean I saw a man grow a lung back right he lost from cancer win without soul healed Wow and I believe the soul the wound that was inside him actually caused the cancer in the first place yeah see a good a good biblical example of sickness and the soul is the man at the Pool of Bethesda remember him said he he had an infirmity for thirty-eight years right that’s a long time to be sick and a lot of people are in that situation exactly today yeah there’s so many mysterious illnesses that even the doctors don’t know how to diagnose because they don’t know how to diagnose the soul hmm I think that’s one of the issues right for the amount of the pool 38 years what was it that made him in that state for that long right well the Bible says he had an infirmity for 38 years if you look at that word infirmity in the Strong’s it means weakness and infirmity of the body and of the soul so was saying that he had wound inside of his inner man that was causing the sickness now where did that wound come front right well it came from sin and we know that from the words of Jesus himself when did he say that man after he got him healed he saw him in the temple he said I see your well now stop sinning right or something worse may happen to you see when we sin or someone sins against us or our ancestors sinned it can wound us and then cause disease right come upon us yeah for sure for sure even demonic oppression you know we see a lot of people you know they’re doing they’re making more with the enemy and and they’re doing what the Bible says to do you know no weapon formed against us shall prosper greater is He that’s in me than he that’s in the world the name of Jesus I command you to leave but they’re not having success or battling that spear and it’s not leaving it could be not every time but it could be because there is a legal landing strip is solely for that spirit to be there and a good example is the woman bowed over with the spirit of infirmity remember her 18 years right her spine is literally bent by a spirit a demon was bending her spine that is like almost beyond our ability to proceed right but nonetheless that’s what the Bible said right so what was allowing that spirit to literally affect her bones like that well it said she had a spirit of infirmity right the same word used to describe the man at the pool right it means infirmity and weakness in the soul right so she had something going on in here that allowed the spirit to be there once we get this healed we’ll start to see a lot of things change will start to see miracles happen in our bodies our minds our marriages our relationships our finances we’ll see our authority over demonic spirits will greatly increase right I mean today Katie you know like there’s a lot of I think frivolous thinking regarding sin issues in the body of Christ I see it everywhere it’s like oh well I’m under grace oh that’s fine it doesn’t matter you know but it really does and the reason why God hates sin so much is because it can damage you or it says it hurts us and he hates anything that hurts us so we don’t want to go navel-gazing as far as oh I’m going to keep looking because if your sin conscious that’s going to destroy you also yes it is but we don’t want to ignore the fact that right that our souls need to be rightly stewarded watch over are your hearts with all diligence because from it flow the issues of life scripture says it’s true you know just like simple things like being offended at somebody let’s say somebody really does you wrong and they really have hurt you and you’ve really not done anything to deserve it right what happens is some people mistakenly respond by becoming offended saying words that person I can’t believe what they did you know how they have the nerve you know they need to repent they’re completely wrong and we begin to complain and be offended well the Bible says in like proverbs 16 I believe it is or proverbs 26 it says the words of a slander or a whisper are like deadly wounds yeah that go down to the innermost part of the being so we think we have the right right you say stuff about this person because they did this and this and this and this right but we’re actually putting deadly wounds on ourselves and causing sickness point oh yeah one of the times I heard you speak on offense it was really enlightening because I think you were sharing a testimony about how you’re walking through an airport and going through the security lines and you’re offended because of you know someone not moving fast enough attending and you know so often things like that happened in all of our lives right every day but we we don’t even think its offense because you know it just feels like you know we’re you know we have a right to say it we have a right to think it I mean after all and it just becomes natural to us but God wants us to come to a place where we are so in tune with his love yes and with his purity and everything that that that will realize no that’s not his nature right it’s not him thinking gosh that’s why I’m feeling like that and so that we can walk free from woundedness by by by being in the healers love in the in in wholeness himself we gotta connect the dots I remember this gentleman in like San Diego he had a severe sinus affection and he had it for years and years and it was so bad it stunk okay was always running and you could smell it people around him could smell it was that bad why when talk about the soul at a meeting and about being offended and he said the prayers and he got instantly healed it dried up the smell left and everything and he was amazed because he never connected this horrible infection with him being offended and it wounding his soul Wow yeah it was amazing yeah well and so one round of repentance and cleansing cleansed everything yes it’s true oh and there’s another thing there too you know i lead people through repentance and that’s the first step we should always particular cross first because jesus died for every sin right including every sin that would ever wound us but there’s something i think that the body of christ is left out of their daily prayer life and that is for taking of something they already have and that’s Dunamis resurrection power that lives in them right so let me just explain what that is okay so the Bible talks about in Romans 1 that we that Paul said I’m not ashamed of the gospel which is the power unto salvation right he’s talking about this power that caused us to become saved born again it’s resurrection power it comes into us and it causes our dead spirit to be resurrected in the new eternal life right right okay will that power that Paul is talking about there in the Greek gets the word Dunamis now this is a this is an amazing power right okay Dunamis is resurrection power it causes us to be born again it comes and lives inside of us so right now every believer has a tankful that never runs out right okay well that word Dunamis if you look it up in the Strong’s one of its meanings is excellence of soul yes I love it so we don’t realize right now we got a tank full oh yeah power that can make us excellent a soul I can heal every single wound we already have it because Jesus is excellent of soul and he is eternal life and he’s dwelling within us and when you just think of like this excellence of Jesus and thought word and indeed lives in on the inside and the heat comes in fills our human soul oh that’s how we’re taken into his image his likeness because he’s living in there and he’s given us that power to heal every bit of woundedness that could ever come upon us when we talked about anything else that we do awesome yes you know we are going to come right back after this message but I want you to get ready to be ministered to we’re going to learn about the power of decree and how decrees can heal your soul there’s going to be miracles and we’re going to pray for those things and if you have need of a miracle right now maybe you have a an infirmity that you’ve lived with for a number of years don’t be surprised if you don’t get a miracle anointing this very day where every symptom lifts off of you we’ll be right back do you feel like your prayers aren’t getting through do you struggle with sickness financial difficulty or relational issues soul decrees by Katie Souza is

collection of downloadable resource it’s happened before revival fires fell and releasing massive waves of miracles healings signs and wonders setting hearts on fire gloria my present it is happening again twenty two speakers unite at the historic angeles temple to relight the revival fires and release an atmosphere of miracles signs and wonders it’s time for you to arise and be a woman on the front lines okay so Katie tell us more about this Dunamis power because it’s one thing to be able to you know recognize that there’s a need for repentance and that yeah but repentance is one thing but applying that Dunamis power is another yes you know you gotta know for sure that it works cuz Jesus used it that’s what acts 10:38 says God anointed Jesus Christ with Holy Spirit and power which is Dunamis and he went around healing everyone that was oppressed by the devil and when the woman touched Jesus’s the hem of His garment ruin oh right says he felt that healing virtue that word is Dunamis and she had been traumatized by that 12u her long says so I believe he healed her in her soul made her excellence all and healed her physical bodies and even if the issue of blood itself wasn’t related to the soul yeah the shame and everything that came with that condition would have damaged the soul and that’s what I loved about that whole story is that he presented her after she was healed he made sure publicly everyone knew that she was cleansed yeah it’s clear that whole issue I love to care everything he took care of everything Jesus all right now seriously okay so decrees is another good thing now you’re the decree expert you know I’ve read your book the trade and it’s awesome I think everyone needs to incorporate decrees it’s one of the simple ways that you can release the power you already have because if your blood you have and a decree is a governmental proclamation yeah we’ve got the King of Kings the word of the King of Kings that we decree and the the Bible says that when you send forth that word through decree you know that word does not return void it accomplishes everything it is sent to do so it’s powerful it’s active its operative as it says in Hebrews and is so powerful decrees are so powerful yeah you know job talks on we decree a thing and it shall be and she’ll be established so that helps establish and our healing for us in her soul and in her body right it’s so cool cuz you know Jesus made decrees when he would heal people you know he went around saying to people that were crippled and stuff arise right pick up your mat and walk he was releasing a decree to them except well that were to rise it’s so cool because if you look it up but it’s actually a resurrection term it’s the same term used for you know the when when Jairus daughter arose right and when Jesus command us go out heal the sick raise the dead so when he would say to people arise pick up your Matlock he was loosing a decree that was releasing the Dunamis he was carrying beautiful you know and it would heal that person in their in her soul and in their physical body right so that’s what we need to start doing too is start releasing decrees you know that’s why I wrote the book so that people could have a list of them if they didn’t know what to do that it’s called soul a soul decrees and so these are specific decrees to heal the soul and to empower the soul and to come into healing wholeness and an empowerment it’s awesome when they do them then the physical body will follow suit their marriage will follow suit you know every part of them will follow suit their finances will start to prosper right so it’s a good practice that’s a very simple but totally effective way is releasing the Word of God though that’s what James says the word has the power to save our soul yes you know that word say there is so so so it means holy deliver prosper yes awesome using we’ve seen so many things happen and in our in our you know meetings and in our personalized to and it happened through a decree right like I would get a word of knowledge and I would stand on the stage and make a decree say a scripture or say a decree you know I hear someone’s being healed of you know knee problems right now someone being healed of cancer I find and I would speak a scripture and I command that your soul would be prospered by health even as your body would be prospered and brought my health even as your soul prospers and then you know miracles that start to pop pop pop pop pop so it’s very simple for us to do this but so very powerful and Katie you actually have in your ministry you train people how to operate in this it’s not like you’re just up there on the platform doing this just yourself you actually equipped the body to do this and I know people have been under your training we’re out ministering to the sick feeling people’s souls casting out Devils all of that and so thank you so much for your contribution yeah because it’s amazing it’s been super fun but you know people don’t feel like they need me to lay hands on them because I’m teaching them how to do it right you know we’ve just even you know even in my own inner circle my staff and people in in my family in my ministry are getting huge miracles signs and wonders because they’ve learned how to do it you know one of my my very faithful employees john blake had a rare disease where he had ammonia storing in his brain right his body wasn’t releasing it and it would cause him like alzheimer’s like symptoms right he wouldn’t be able to remember remember simple tasks like typing he wouldn’t be able to finish his sentences his wife would have to finish him for him he wouldn’t be able to remember the plot of a movie even though he just watched the movie it was horrible he would spend like $1,500 a month on medications that would prevent him from going into a coma like sleep Wow it was terrible for him and God just released a word a nagy one day to us said it was his soul that there was an issue in the soul and then if we prayed for it it would be healed and he would be healed too and he came over the house and I just you know I prayed over him a decrese soaked him and within I don’t know probably 45 minutes he stood up and the first thing he recognized was that his mind was clear Wow he he could think so much clearer than he had in years and years and then he went home and all his life he’d had this smell of ammonia on his body and all of a sudden he gets in the shower to take a shower and it’s gone right he’s so convinced after the days you know past that he’s healed he has three of his doctors to give a test independently each one all comes back first time in years his ammonia level is normal it’s awesome it was awesome awesome a lot of times people think that you know like when the soul gets healed and then the physical body responds but it also affects other areas I can there John it says in every respect yes in all respects of life I want you to prosper and be in health even as your soul prospers so that could be also your prosperity of provision yes your prosperity of relationships and that and you’ve seen miracles in those areas as well especially in financial breakthroughs in people’s lives and you know as you yes you know seeing clearance in the area of the soul then other things come into alignment as well I’ve had huge financial miracles given to me and the ministry because I got my soul healed and it was so cool God would always connect the miracle with the provision coming in like something would happen I would have an awareness that there was an issue my soul like I’m sure most reviewers know my history I think I used to be a criminal in the streets I would rob people I knew in federal prison I was a federal prison I sold dope I was a collector I forced people to pay debts by gunpoint and I remember when the ministry started really taking off the Lord said you can’t continue to carry around those wounds in your soul that came from all that sin right because now I have to trust you to steward faithfully right and with integrity millions of dollar right and that’s no joke and we take that seriously I mean we’re members of the ECF a that’s how serious and I just want to say knowing you personally for like since you started in ministry really is I want to say how much I appreciate your integrity you’re a woman of virtue you are a woman who truly has watched over her soul and you watch over the finance of the ministry as unto the Lord in such a beautiful way and I want to commend you for that and your husband and your team we have gone out of our way we have independent audits done on us all the time to make sure that every eye you know is dotted every T is crossed and we’ve done really well in that we feel really happy that God has allowed us to work in that in that level of integrity but in all we can’t just say well let me just say this because I think this is so important there are so many Christiane’s you know you’re saved you’re you’re you know you you love the Lord but when you don’t watch over your soul in the area financial stewardship and when you don’t have integrity in that area how can we be trusted with true riches how can we really steward what God has us to Stewart so I just want you to examine your heart so you know and say am i stewarding my finances the way that God wants me to store them and especially if you’re a Christian minister and you are storing the funds that come into the ministry I know @xp we are very very serious about the way funds are handled and that nothing gets wasted and that we’re we’re careful with expenditures in that and so please you know I just make an appeal to you to make sure there’s alignment in that area and I think let me go to that see when we have woundedness inside of us it controls every part of our soul the way we think about the money the decisions we make with the money and we can even get emotional with the money and and we have to be healed in our soul right now in that parable of the talents remember the master leaves and goes his servants talents we said that he gave three of his servants talents according to their abilities right did you know that word ability there is the word Dunamis really well you can almost read it like this excellence of soul right it means that he gave them talents according to the exercise oh wow we have the Dunamis in notes we all have the same mana tournament yeah we all have a tankful that never runs out but how much of it is that working us right how much of in are we releasing how much are we going okay I I want to make sure I am totally operating with utmost integrity in my finances so I want and releases Dunamis I already have from my spirit in my soul to heal every wound in my soul that might be connected to finances right I repent for anything I’ve done you know bad stewardship wastefulness AXS extortion anything an enemy soul that needs money to make it feel good yeah you know the idolatry of it yes I remember some people there are adorable people that love Jesus they had gotten an inheritance and they called me so would you please help us decide what to to you know invest in and so I began to pray with them and I said you know I feel like you’re supposed to wait until you get more healing in your soul before you move on then that night the the wife has a dream she has a huge diamond and these zombies are trying to steal it from her she calls me and tells me the dream and I said oh my gosh it’s what I told you see zombies are the walking dead right that’s what soul wounds are there are things that are supposed to be dead but they’re still alive and kicking and they’re trying to eat your stuff Wow okay and I said they’re trying these soul wounds are gonna try to steal your diamond your watch don’t make a move until you get more healing they didn’t listen though and they lost it all oh they lost every penny we have to be so careful we need to be healed in here first yes then God will give us more finances because he can trust us and when you make decrees over your soul that actually helps fortify the healing though we just have a couple minutes left I love to minister to the people so why don’t you go as a spirit lead too and let’s release healing to soul wounds all right let’s work on the finances because so many people need help in that area let’s just ask God to first cleanse us of any sin we might have committed with our finances so why don’t we just pray together okay just say Lord Jesus our repent for anything sinful that I have done with my finances our repent for excess bad stewardship extortion gambling Ussery manipulation in Jesus name all sin I’ll repent for that’s connected to my finances I put the blood of Jesus on it I’m just saying into that okay now let’s do the second step because if you don’t if you don’t start releasing Dunamis in you you won’t become excellent of soul that wound will still be their sins gone but the wound stays behind controlling you okay so not just put your hand on your belly and just say Jesus I released what I already have I have a tank full of Dunamis and I release it now to go into my soul to every woundedness in me that’s controlling my finances send Dunamis into my mind so I think right thoughts about money send it to my will so I get healed and make right decisions about my money and send it into my emotions so I don’t make emotional decisions with my finances to say I release the Dunamis now decree I am excellent of soul in Jesus name Amen awesome thank you so much Katie we want to thank you so much for joining us on today’s program and I’d love for you to visit us at XP ministries.com and especially look up

16386,139_1-7,0,MARCO_16_152600909-2,0,"Video Transcript we’re going to be doing a whole lot of flipping around a whole lot of flippin I want you to go to second Chronicles if you will and I’m going to actually begin at the first verse and then I’ll try to call it out as I go but I’m excited for God’s a word thank you praise team band everybody for taking us into the presence of the Lord beginning at the first verse the Bible said sometime later the Moabites and the ammonites accompanied by the me unites they join forces to make war on Jehoshaphat verse 3 shaken Jehoshaphat prayed because sometimes when you really shake it to the cordless that’s what you do so shaken Joseph had prayed and he went to God for help and he ordered a nationwide fast the country of Judah United in seeking God’s help and they came from all the cities of Judah to pray to God go to verse 25 and when Jehoshaphat and his people came to carry off the plunder they found more loot than they could carry off equipment clothing valuables as a matter of fact it took three days to cart it away and on the fourth day they came together at the valley of blessing Baraka and they blessed God that’s how it got its name the valley of blessing now just a few verses earlier in verse three shaken some translations say was trouble he was worried he was bothered but here now just a few late verses later and there’s a whole lot of stuff that happened in between and I’m gonna try to hit the highlights of it today but I want to just talk for a few moments from a particular subject look to your neighbor on your right and say neighbor being overwhelmed by the battle – being overloaded by the blessing tell somebody else being overwhelmed by the battle to being overloaded by the blessing it all happened in a day’s journey from overwhelmed to overloaded well not just overloaded with troubles of burden of pressure but overloaded by the blessing sphere to God we thank you for your word it’s a timely word we honor you your word is always on time I pray for the anointing to deliver it into this room thank you for touching your people thank you for speaking confirmation in this house somebody came to hear have your way in here today God take over this room right now just take it over see what you want to say and do what you want to do and will thank you for it in Jesus name somebody just stand there for a second clap your hands and give God a praise in advance come on praise Him in advance for finding you today for speaking to you today for giving you a word that you can walk out here with and live with all week long thank you too dad god I thank you today for your word in Jesus name Amen and amen on your way down just hit somebody tell him from overwhelmed too overloaded overwhelmed to overload it y’all got to say Amen real loud because I can’t really see y’all good because the lights are in my face so I know you out there cuz of philia but say man every now and then thank you thank you y’all are awesome one of the most common complaints that that I hear or common phrases or common sentences or words that I hear today and probably you here too is is the phrase I am just over well over well now most of the time the people who say that they’re telling you the truth because there is a lot today that we can find ourselves overwhelmed by there’s this there’s just too many decisions that have to be made there’s one of the worst things I can stand it is when I you know cuz I will usually spend Saturday prepping for today and I come in here and preach this first service out preach second service and when church is over if my I can’t take it when my family looks at me and says where are we going to eat I just want to bop him upside the head cuz I haven’t been listening and hearing and I’ve been focused and I’ve been delivering and I made a I’ve made a hundred decisions in the last 24 hours if not more on what we’re doing right here right now and so the last thing that I want you to say to me is where are we going to eat so if you have a catering business we would love frite no I’m just kidding I’m just kidding most of the time I want to go home and go to bed because I’m just wore out but but I feel like it can just in case somebody one somebody make a decision on where we can go eat so that I can I can just walk out here and you say here’s where we’re going to eat today obviously nobody can do that so but the truth of the matter is is that there are so many decisions if you really stop to count the decisions that you make every day of your life you would be shocked to know how many decisions you make there’s just there’s there’s so many expectations that you that you and I feel like we have to meet there’s calls that have to be returned or you have to make the decision not to return the calls there’s there is request that you have to fulfill there are emails that you have to answer or you don’t answer and there are there are social media inbox messages so and then if that’s not enough on Instagram then you got to go to Facebook and they’ve got inboxes and we got so many boxes we’re about to be boxed in is what we’re about to be we’ve got friend requests that we should answer we’ve got and then when we go home and sit down and turn the TV on we have too many channels to choose from I just just overwhelmed I’m like when I was a kid we had three channels abies CBS and NBC that was it and they went off at two o’clock in the morning but they like that today and now we got so many things and then when you do decide to go somewhere to eat some of these restaurants there the menus are so complicated you just want to shut it like don’t even go to the Cheesecake Factory I’m just telling you never go there when you’re tired and when you’re really hungry because you’re just like what what is all of this right here you know I I got tickle s yesterday because I was reading a story about this woman who said that she she said I moved into a new apartment and I was glad to begin there and that by the time I’m getting everything unloaded unpacked I realized I don’t have a toilet brush for the bathroom so she said I went to Amazon and I started looking for a toilet brush she said do you know they sell on Amazon they sell 1161 different kinds of taller brushes now imagine that she said after about an hour of comparing the brushes and comparing the price difference in the brushes and reading all the conflicting reviews that came with all of the brushes she said I finally just got up got dressed I jumped in my car I drove to the local dollar store I walked in and I bought the only brand of toilet brushes that they sold there’s so many options and the more that our options increase our level of certainty about our choices begins to decrease because when you you make a choice you say okay I’m gonna use this I’m gonna take that and but because you have so many options you’re like I don’t know I I don’t know if that’s what I should do or if I should and the next thing you know you’re just consumed she said I wasted an hour just looking at all the reviews and the prices and comparing and I just wanted to toll it rush nobody was gonna see if it was just a toilet brush I mean it’s crazy the options that are out there today have you went to the coffee aisle in the grocery store Lee I mean if you’re a if you’re a newcomer to coffee you are gonna be confused as I don’t know what because there are so many options that are in how about toothpastes have you ever looked at how many options we have with toothpaste listen I just want spearmint I want peppermint all right I just want gel I want pace listen why do I have to go through all of that stuff just give me something that will help me and help people that come in contact with me and God forbid that you ever get a cold because if you ever have to go to the medicine aisle listen you go to the medicine aisle they say do you want something for runny eyes or do you want something for runny nose do you flu symptoms or do you have a cold is your ears burning or are they tingling or are they ringing is this your sinuses or is this your allergies or do you want non-drowsy or drowsy do you want 12 hours or do you want 24 hours what do you want I want you to go away that’s what I want seriously it can be totally overwhelming I mean I used to think Baskin Robbins 31 flavors was overwhelming it’s a breeze now when I was a kid I thought it was overwhelming because as I grew up we only had chocolate or vanilla and occasionally we would have Neapolitan does anybody know any apologies all my old folks they know what that is that’s that’s that’s when you get all three vanilla chocolate and strawberry so those are fun things that we can laugh about it comes to being overwhelmed but there are some serious things today that are overwhelming people people are overwhelmed by their debt it seems like just it’s just overwhelming the way especially if you have credit card debt how it can just the compound interest and god forbid that we would ever oh that I rs anything because they’re gonna get compound interest they’re gonna get penalties they’re gonna get all of that stuff people are overwhelmed student loans they they are there they’re overwhelmed by child care costs like I have to have a family I want to have a family but I make it costs me just as much to put them in in daycare as it does I feel sorry for kids today people today I didn’t have all those options when when my kids were coming up and but to think about it today it gets overwhelming people get overwhelmed by health care costs like do I do I do I do I pay for my medicine or do I repair the roof that’s over my head you know it’s just it gets overwhelming and then and then yours there’s your workload you’ve got to work and you got this load and just as soon as you think you have got your desk pretty much cleared off here comes about a truckload of other things and next thing you know it’s out of control people are overwhelmed by regret they’ve been through stuff then it’s it and they’ve got so much regret that it just stays present and forefront in their minds they’re over there overloaded by shame they’re overloaded by guilt they’re overloaded by worry and by fear some people are overloaded by the by the lack of security they want to be and want to have more security overwhelmed by pain overwhelmed by loss overwhelmed by anger overwhelmed by by grief overwhelmed by resentment and bitterness overwhelmed by the conflict between you and your kids or if everything’s good between you and your kids it’s between your kids and your kids and it’s just so much so so much as it’s causing us to be overwhelmed should we stay here should we move should we do this should we do that it’s it’s it can be absolutely overwhelmed it if you weren’t overwhelmed when I got up you’re overwhelmed right now overwhelmed in our families overwhelmed in our marriages we’re living in the same house but we’re also living in two different worlds it can be overwhelming what do you do when you find yourself overwhelmed and so today that’s that’s what I want to talk about in the man that’s gonna help me talk about that is that I I really like him he’s a cool guy his name is Josh AFET I mean listen a name like that is overwhelming can you imagine can you imagine when you go to kindergarten please spell your name spell jaws how many syllables in my name that’s overwhelming can you imagine what he what he felt like when he had to write and imagine his nickname think about that people that didn’t want to call him Joe ha stuff that they probably just called him Jay fat or fat you know it’s just that’s overwhelming in and of itself hello can Jay fat come out and play today it’s crazy but I really like Jehoshaphat I like him because he’s a good guy he was a good King and he is a really good leader he had a strange name and I don’t know why his mother did that but anyway I hope you’re naming jaha’s have had him here today just come down here right now I’m gonna pray for you so the Bible tells us that that he was a great leader he led the entire nation of Israel into a revival it was it was just a reviving that he brought death to them and in second chronicles 19 and 4 the Bible says that King Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and he went among the people from bear Sheva to the mountains of Ephraim and he brought them back to the Lord God of their fathers he went to all of the little cities he didn’t just go to the big cities he went to all the little cities he went to where the real people lived and he got down with him and he hung out with him and by doing this he caused them to turn their hearts back to God you would be amazed to know just how far it how far reaching your willingness to come to where people are what would really go it could possibly cause them to turn their hearts back to God and so because of his efforts that he was a great success and there was a great spiritual awakening that came to Israel it was really he and the spiritual awakening was very good for the nation of Israel however we all know that that good is often going to be followed by something bad if we can just be honest today it’s a good time but you can’t hardly enjoy the good time for fear of what the bad time is going to bring we know that for every mountaintop you can always expect that there will be a valley we know that with every high somewhere there’s going to be a low we know that with every setup there’s probably somebody waiting in the wings to set you back it’s just life it’s it’s it’s how it’s it’s how it is there’s always the day after the wedding everybody looks forward to the wedding it’s exciting you build to order but then there’s the day after when it’s all over if there’s the day after Christmas we’re excited about Christmas but then you wake up the next day after Christmas and your kids are already bored and you don’t spend a thousand dollars on a little toys and they look at you and say can we go to Chuck E Cheese you know it’s it’s the day after the Super Bowl party everybody’s excited on the day but then there’s the day you wake up and it’s over how about the New Year’s Eve party everybody’s excited New Year’s Eve it’s all changing we’re getting everything behind us hallelujah but then you wake up in is January 1st and we’re just back to our routine so on a personal note I I have noticed that on the heels of most every one of my life’s greatest blessings or greatest achievements or greatest victories or one of my life’s greatest testimonies right on the heel heels of that there will always come a test anybody ever noticed that it’s just you no sooner get through celebrating till you realize oh shoot I’m in the middle of another test and this this particular happens it particularly happens when we make a fresh commitment to God anybody ever made a fresh commitment to God you’re in church on Sunday and you’re excited tears are rolling down your face you feel God you’re like God I’m gonna be I’m gonna change my life bringing my life into alignment with you I’m getting my house in order Cod I’m gonna get it all together and and next thing you know here comes a test without fail that happens and and sometimes the test comes through people that you love because not everybody is happy about your commitment to Christ and somebody is going to challenge your decision the enemy’s going to always make sure that somebody is there to challenge your decision somebody is gonna be angry because you have made up in your mind I’ve changed uniforms today I’ve changed sides I’ve changed ugly gence as I am in the Lord’s army today somebody is going to be upset at that upset about that because anytime you are the friend of God you are the enemy of Satan it just happens to work like that and and so that’s that’s what happens here that’s what was happening here in second chronicles chapter 20 and verse 1 it says in the King James or in the New King James it says after this after this after what after after the spiritual awakening happened that I just told you about after this the armies of the Moabites the ammonites and some of the Mia Knights declared war on Jehoshaphat of course they did because we just come through a great celebration so he is the king of a small country called Israel and three of his his enemies that get together and they decide that they’re going to gang up on him you ever felt like the life just ganged up on you maybe I’m preaching to the wrong Church by I’m gonna find somebody else to preach this to cuz they’ll get it I said do you ever feel like life just has ganged up on you so then the Bible says then then some messengers came and they told you Hoss effete in an inner that a great multitude or a huge combined army is coming against you and they’re coming from the Dead Sea and Jehoshaphat starts feeling overwhelmed because his enemies are ganging up on him and and I and I know it that’s that’s like sometimes you feel like I don’t know where you’ve been hit on the right and then as soon as you’re like pulling yourself together from that here comes something out on the left and and you’re being hit on every side by by the enemy and it seems like everything was going right but now it’s all going wrong at the same time anybody know what I’m talking about anybody had a week like that so that’s what King Jehoshaphat was feeling and things were going good the nation was was in revival all of a sudden he hears that the three armies of his enemies have United together and they are on their way to destroy him so now he’s facing a triple threat and he did just to be honest he’s a king but he is overwhelmed the Bible says that shaken Jay said yeah that’s what I’m gonna call him Jay fat said himself to seek the Lord he’s overwhelmed he’s scared and he’s shaken but look what he does he sets himself to seek the Lord he went to God for help and he also ordered that the entire nation make a sacrifice and begin a fast now there’s a lesson right there in that all by itself wouldn’t you feel overwhelmed by a problem do not let that problem intimidate you but make it motivate you to pray more okay why why should I be intimidated when I can be motivated look at somebody and say don’t be intimidated be motivated I’m overwhelmed but at the same time I’m more motivated to seek God in prayer I’m motivated to trust him more I’m motivated to believe more I’m motivated to depend and lean upon him more I’m overwhelmed but I’m also expecting more so you won’t either do one of the other you’ll be intimidated and you’ll back up or you’ll say oh right and you’ll become motivated and you’ll get yourself ready for whatever you have to get yourself ready so the first thing that Joseph had does is he makes it a matter of personal prayer the second thing that he does is he gets not only himself but he tells the whole nation around him to pray I want you to look at your neighbor and say neighbor I dare you to pray about it now look at that same neighbor and say back to their neighbor I dare you to pray about it see well what I want to pull from this story today there are five things that I’m gonna give you that Jehoshaphat did when he felt overwhelmed so if you are in this place get your iPad get pin get something out because I’m gonna give you something to take home with you today because I want you to put this in practice every time that you feel as if you are overwhelmed and and you know what if you don’t feel like you’re overwhelmed today take this down anyway cuz one of these days you’re gonna wake up and see where is that message pastor Brady was preaching about being overwhelmed so I want you to write this down what do you do when you’re overwhelmed the first thing that Jay fat did what he did I person said it the first thing that Jehoshaphat did when he let me say it like this there are five things he did and they worked for him and I would almost stake my life on it today that what I’m getting ready to tell you if that they work for him but they’re gonna work for you too I’m telling you I’m convinced up there there are five thinks the first thing that there are five right moves that he made when he was overwhelmed when you’re overwhelmed you can’t afford to make a wrong move so I need you to write this down the five write loses one of the first write moves he made was he turned to God write that down the first right move he made was he turned to God he didn’t turn to friends he didn’t turn to his military capabilities he didn’t turn to his weapons he didn’t turn to human reasoning he didn’t turn to social media to take it out on social media he didn’t turn to to rant to anybody he didn’t turn to his followers he didn’t start developing a plan there’s nothing wrong with the plan everybody needs a plan but before you develop a plan you need to pray and as you pray God will give you his plan and not your plan okay so you’ve got to turn to prayer before you turn to your plan prayer should be our first choice and not our last resort I said prayer should be our first choice and not our last resort oftentimes we wait till we get to the point where prayer is the last thing that we can do we’ve all heard people say well all we can do now is just you’re heard somebody say that before all we can do now is just pray we’ve done tried everything we know and so all we’re gonna do right now is we’re just gonna put it in the hands of God and we’re going to pray no we should have prayed before you ever done anything else prayer should have been our first choice and not our last resort I’m so most say until somebody hears it today God is saying you’re not praying to me you’re asking everybody else you’re trying to work it in your head you’re trying to figure out how you can do it you’re trying to make your next move and God said stop a minute and talk to me about it you should go straight to God and say God I got trouble coming from everywhere I’ve got financial trouble I’ve got to help him tails issues I got family trouble I got emotional trouble Lord I’m spiritually in trouble and I need your help somebody said I need your help that’s what Jay Joseph had did Jehoshaphat said not only am I gonna pray about it he said but I’m gonna get this entire nation to pray he said the country in in verse 4 in the message he says the country of Judah United in seeking God’s help they came from all of the cities of Judah to pray to God see once it gets the whole nation to pray once it gets gets everybody all the national leaders to come together and pray then he opens up his mouth okay first he’s just praying to God second he gets everybody else in there to pray with him but then when everybody gets there he publicly opens his mouth and he starts calling on the name of the Lord sometimes you can’t just pray in your head and you can’t just bring in your heart sometimes you got to open your mouth and let everybody around you hear you call on God sometimes he wants to hear your voice and then good enough for me to pray for you some situations you got to pray for yourself he did that that’s leadership right there that’s amazing leadership right there if we could get some of our political people our spiritual people our social leaders our local leaders our national leaders to come together and pray to lay aside denomination and pray just set aside our differences and pray to put our logos and our egos in the floor and just begin to pray I believe that we would hear from heaven did somebody say man right there cuz there’s no problem that is too big and there is no problem that is too small for us to pray about if it’s big enough for you to worry about it’s big enough for you to pray about hallelujah so I want to teach you exactly how he prayed because I believe that if you’ll apply this to your life when you’re overwhelmed let’s go work for you too so so what did I say the first thing he did was he turned to God for help okay and then in verses all the way down from verses 6 to verses 12 he asks God for questions he asks are you not do you not is there not will you not each one of those requests was a way of praying to God because of of heat because of the fact that he was under attack so the first thing he said that the Bible says he did he turned to God in prayer the second thing that he did was he focused on God and not the problem now hear me I know that’s going right over your head today and you’re adding think about going in one ear and out the other but I dare you to apply this to your life he’s focused on God and not his problem have you have you have you asked anybody the question like have you ever just looked and say hey how are you doing and their answer is B will be like well under the circumstances I’m doing okay well number one why are you under the circumstance you need be on top of the circumstances okay not on dirt but on top all right circumstances are like a mattress if you get on top of it you’ll rest if you get underneath it you’re gonna suffocate tell somebody to get on top get on top so when you need when you pray you need to turn your focus off of the problem and turn your focus on to the solution turn your focus on to God and if you continue here’s why because if you continue to look at the negative if you continue to focus on the problem where the focus goes the power flows and what was little becomes big big big big and bigger so if you focus on the lack the black is gonna get bigger if you focus on the problem the problem will get bigger if you focus on the negative all the negativity is going to get bigger and you will continue to feel overwhelmed so Jehoshaphat made the decision in prayer and he asked it for ways I told him to put I got my notes y’all gotta up up under number two I want you to write a B C and D here’s the four ways he did it when he began to pray the Bible said he remembered how big God was he remembered how big God was the bigger you realize how you’re God the bigger that you recognize how big your God is the smaller your your problem is going to become your problem is going to shrink when God expands in your life do you understand that when God gets big the problem gets small so you me and here’s why because he is all-powerful he is always in control he is all-knowing there is nothing that is too hard for him and with God all things are possible so he said in verse 6 are you not God in heaven this is how this man is praying are you not God in heaven do you not rule over the kingdoms of the nations and is your hand and in your hand is there not power and is there not mine so that no one is able to withstand you when’s the last time you went to God like that he called God out that’s exactly what he did he’s saying yeah I’ve got some problems but I know this I know that you are bigger than my problems so he remembered how big God was second thing he did is he remembered what God had done in the past well write that down you gotta remember what God has done in the past he said I realized that I’ve been in tough times and tight places before but I also know that I’m still here I know that I have survived them I know that I have come through them I know that I have outlasted them I know that I have outlived them because I know and whom I have believed and I and persuaded that he was able and if that God did it from me then the same God that did it for me then is gonna do it for me right now look at somebody say he’ll do it again so he said in verse 7 he says Oh God did you not drive out those who lived in this land before you brought your people Israel here he’s reminding God you did this before he’s saying hey aren’t you the one that brought us here we didn’t even come here ourselves we didn’t ask to be here you’re the one that established us you brought us in and you brought us in through Abraham and then we went down into Egypt and we got enslaved for 400 years and when Moses brought us back did you not take care of those enemies for us then and now they’re trying to return and here we are trying to get in our homeland and you took care of them you wiped them out from us and now God here they come again he says you took care of them back then and you took care of them in my past you won’t take care of them in my future do you hear the confidence he’s saying I know who you are and I know what you’re able to do if you don’t know that in your belly then you’ll never get anywhere in God but you at some point you’ve got to say I know you are and I know what kind of power you had you need to remind yourself when you are feeling overwhelmed that one God is a big card and number two if he helped you before he will help you again and then I love how he starts recollecting this in verse 9 he said you helped us when we face disasters you were there for us when we were in wars you there went disease hit us you were there when we were facing famine he said I remember how big you are I remember what you have done and here’s the third one I remember what you promised well look at your neighbor and say neighbor you got to know what he’s promised there are 7,000 promises in the Word of God and a sure sign that you don’t know what God has promised to you is the fact that you worry you can’t worry and believe his promise at the same get somebody tell him I believe God I believe God Jehoshaphat said God I know how I know you’re big I know what you’ve done and I also know what you promised does anybody know what God has promised you he said I know what you promised and because of that he said I’m up staying on your promise did he did you not give this land to your friend Abraham and to his descendants and did you not give it to us forever you did not put a time frame on this you said this was ours forever didn’t you promise this property to us did you say this was our land didn’t you say this was our parking lot did you say this was our church didn’t you say this was my house did you call it the promised land on purpose so I want to know how you gonna keep your word God are you gonna let these three enemies come in and try to wipe us out he’s overwhelmed but his confidence is coming back I can hear it he said I remember how big you are I remember what you’ve done and I remember what you promised fourth thing he said I remember your character he said I know what kind of God you are I know that you’re a good god I know that you’re a faithful God I know that you’re a loving God I know that you’re a fair God I know that you’re an honest God I know that you are just and I know that you are even-handed so here let me really quick in one minute give you just a little backdrop to this story for hundreds of years earlier when Moses got the Jews out of slavery and started brought them back to the promised land there were three tribes that had already moved in while Israel had been enslaved three tribes and their names were the Amorite the Moabites and the me unites and God specifically told the Jews as he was bringing them in don’t worry about them don’t fight them let them live right there leave them alone let them stay where they are he said I don’t want you to fight them I don’t want you to wipe them out I don’t want you to get into this battle because this battle is not yours just leave them on the right side of the Jordan so now you’re up to date a hundred years later there are three tribes and now they are uniting together attempting to try to destroy Israel are you kidding me we could have wiped you out when we came back but we let you live their wing charge you no rent we you stay right where you were we were obeyed God we could have killed you but we’ll let you live and now you gonna get together and act like you don’t kill us you are kidding me so you know it’s awesome that does he immediately goes to appealing to the character of God and he does it in verse 10 in verse 12 and he said look here you didn’t let us touch them when we got here at first we detoured around them we did not lay a hand on them and now they have come to kick us out of the country God that you gave us oh dear God won’t you take care of them we are helpless before these vandal hordes ready to attack us we don’t know what to do we are looking unto you so do you see what Jehoshaphat is doing right there he’s saying God I don’t know how to fix it but I’m turning to you I’m overwhelmed I don’t have the answers there is no way I am going into battle because the odds are against us it’s three armies two one if I take our armies in there their army in there that we are going to lose so I’m turning to you and I’m choosing to focus on you and I’m gonna focus on the problem promise and not the problem but but he said in doing so I’m gonna remind you number one how big you are you’re all-powerful you’re all knowing you’re all able you’re capable number two I’m gonna remind you what you’ve done for me in the past you’ve been there before you helped us out of tighter places than this I’m gonna remind you number three what you promised us about our future I’m calling you out on the gaudy then you said it or you didn’t either you gonna do it or you’re not going to it and I’m asking you God keep your word keep your word to my family keep your word to my household keep your word keep your promise to me and number four he said I’m I’m gonna ask you to fulfill your character I’m gonna asked you to be who you are well okay so y’all got that all that is up under number two I ain’t got time to wait I gotta keep moving so the thing that Jehoshaphat did that was right that you got to do what I got to do that’s right his number one he turned to God for help number two he focused on God and not the problem the third thing that he did that was right he admitted his inability he admitted his inability the first step toward victory in any area of your life is to come out of denial and admit that you can’t fix this I can’t do it on my own I can’t get out of debt on my own I cannot find a job on my own I cannot pay back these school loans on my own I can’t raise these kids on my own I cannot face retirement on my own I’m overwhelmed and I am admitting to you my in abilities that’s what that goes all the way back to that thing that gives you grace when you come before God and say I’m gonna tell you people think I got it together but the truth is I ain’t got it together I can’t fix it if you don’t help me if you don’t fix it it’s not going to be fixed he said we are helpless and we don’t know what to do what is he saying right there he’s saying we don’t have the power and we don’t have the knowledge oh it’s hard to admit that you don’t have the power and you don’t have the knowledge you are the king you’re that king of your world and you find it hard to go to God and say look I’m powerless I’m helpless and I don’t know how to do this and I love what the next verse says he said now all of Judah this was the real men with their little ones who with their wife’s so they weren’t ashamed they didn’t have these milli goes okay cuz they knew what they were in trouble they let their wives and their children see them calling on the name of Jesus they stood before God together and the wives just didn’t wait on the husband’s the wife’s began to pray out to God cover our house cover our family cover our children why because if one of us can put a thousand to flight two of us can put ten thousands of flight and the Bible said that the whole Potter’s House Lord I mean the whole nation started calling on the name of the Lord what do you do when you’re overwhelmed hit somebody and tell them get honest before God my marriage looks like an angle make it God this dream looks like you will never come to pass the plans that I have are all jacked up I need you to help me if you don’t help me I’ll never get a harvest if you don’t help me I’m not gonna make it so what do you do when you’re overwhelmed you pour your heart out you poor young nuts out and you surrender everything to God you turn it over to him and you trust him and when you do here’s how God responds he said in the fifteenth verse he said listen all of you are Judah you inhabitants of Jerusalem and you took King Jason thus says the Lord to you don’t be afraid but that it happened till he got honest that didn’t happen until he was got honest privately and he got honest publicly it’s sad when your title won’t let you access the help that’s right in your house in your home in your business and your family because you got to keep being who you are defeat it at all but when he cried when he gathered people around him that have the same heart the same mind the same vision the voice of the Lord begin to speak do not be afraid don’t be dismayed because of this great multitude why why why are you telling me that because this battle is not yours this battle is God well listen to me I’m your pastor I love you I want your marriage to make it I want your children to make it I want you to make it I want you to get out of debt I want you to get to where you can live comfortably in God but I’m gonna tell you the truth and I can tell you because I know what I’m talking about the reason that were stressed out the reason that we’re exhausted the reason that our marriages are falling apart the reason that we’re weary in well-doing the reason that were checked out the reason that were wore out the reason that were burned out is because we are trying to fight battles that are not ours to fight you’ve got a discern what is your battle and what is the Lord’s you don’t have the energy you don’t have the knowledge you don’t have the power and the reason that we’re feeling frantic about all of this stuff is because we’re trying to be God we are not God God is God I said God is God God is saying did I ever ask you Jos a pet to fight these three armies Oh No haven’t I always taken care of you yeah you’ve always taken care of us haven’t I made some promises to you well I don’t know who I am talking to today and who God brought me here to preach to but I came to tell somebody that God brought me here to tell you that this battle is not yours this battle is the Lord’s this problem is not your yell that big thing that’s in your face right now God said that thing right there this ain’t your battled this ain’t your problem this is not your situation it’s not yours to fix it is God’s to fix and if you stop trying to fix what God has not called you to fix then you will stop being a failure because you’re in over your head and God said I want you to humble yourself I’m wanting you to swallow your pride and I’m wanting you to invite me into your struggle but we keep failing oh god I’m such a failure I messed up I’m so sorry hold up you did not let me down cuz you never held me up to begin with I won’t tell you that right now oh you ain’t that powerful see some of us you have you ever have you ever have you ever sat on a plane and you know it’s getting ready to run down it’s going down the runways getting ready to take off have you ever just started flapping your wings like it was your responsibility for that plane to take off some of you are exhausted right now because you’re walking around flapping your rings trying to get your dream off the ground trying to get your business off the ground trying to get your relationships off the ground you’ve been flapping so hard and you have been doing so long that now you’re about to give up you’re about to throw in the towel you’re about to quit hello and God is saying right back to you uh listen go ahead quit in whatever you know whatever you need to do he said it’s about time it’s about time you give up because that is not the strategy I gave you the strategy I gave you is something different and if you start trying to make it happen and just let it happen you will find out that you got some jet engines attached to you and those jet engines will do all the lifting tell somebody let God do the heavy lifting you’re slapping and all you’re flapping in the world is never going to be enough come on somebody repeat this with me God is God and I’m not God is God and I’m not close your eyes and say it God is God and I I am NOT God the Sun in verse 17 you will not need to fight in this battle look at somebody and tell him it ain’t your battle position yourself he said you ain’t gonna have to fight but this is what you’re gonna have to do position yourself stand still but stand still and see us you know what salvation means the complete deliverance spirit soul and body stand still and see the salvation of the Lord who is with you old Judah is with you all Jerusalem and that happened Jeff had bowed his head and with his face to the ground and all Judah and all of the inhabitants of Jerusalem they bow down before the Lord and they started worshiping the Lord he’s saying boy you can worry or you can worship you can panic or you can praise you can run or you can rest and sometimes it takes more courage to do nothing than it does to do something be stale rest relax and stand firm here’s the fourth thing I got a stop for a thing that he did what was right he thanked God in advance but verse 21 after talking it over with the people Jehoshaphat appointed aquire for God so he’s like ok just say not battle but this is our opportunity to worship I want you to sing and I want you to sing and I want you to say and the Bible said that he he we dressed them in holy robes they even had they even had choir robes Thank You Hafsah fans today and he said I’m dressed him in holy robes and they were to march ahead of the troops and they were to sing and to give thanks to God because his love endure it forever so you got the army back here and you got the choir out there that’s Judah out there and you got the fighter back here look at somebody say sends you the first since universe send you Bray’s out first that’s what he was doing he was sent the praises out in advance and oh hear me today Church and when you start to thanking God in advance for miracles I’m telling you God tells miraculous sometimes we gotta stand still and say thank you sometimes we gotta stand there and when we want to move we gotta resist the urge to move and say nobody it’s my job just to say thank you and the Bible said as in verse 22 as soon as they started praising and shouting to God somebody say at that moment at that moment if you were smart you would be like oh god I just thank you right now that moment God sets ambushment against the men of Amnon against Moe who did it who did it they didn’t have to do it God did it and as they were as they sang the men of Amnon of Moab and Mount Sierra as they were attacking Judah they started attacking Judah they started attacking the praises and next thing you know God got involved and all of them ended up dead can y’all pull it up can y’all pull up verse 24 verse 24 pull it up on the screen so it saved me a minute’s time verse 24 hello okay so when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness they looked toward the multitude and they were dead bodies these are the people that were coming after us keep it going keep it going there were dead bodies they had fallen on the earth and no one had escaped keep going and when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil they found among them an abundance of valuables on the dead bodies did somebody say I’m going in for the kill I’m going in for the kill there was precious jewellery which they stripped off for themselves more than they could even carry away and they were that for three days you’re alone three days three days they were saya three days just gathering up the spoil and they did that because there was so much keep going keep going and on the fourth day they assembled in the valley of Baraka for their they bless the Lord I bet you better bless the Lord therefore the name of that place was called the valley of Baraka until this day keep it going and then they returned every man of Judah and Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat in front of them so it was Judah in front of them now Jehoshaphat is there he said Jehoshaphat said to them go back to Jerusalem and boy y’all better go back with joy I’m telling somebody in this place when you go home today you better go back with joy why why because the law I had made them rejoice over their enemies keep going so they came to Jerusalem and they got strained instruments they got harps they got trumpets and they took it to the house of the Lord and the fear of God was on all the kingdoms I bet there was the kingdoms whose countries when they heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel keep going then the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet why in other words all of his enemies shut up because God I don’t I don’t know for in the message version because I think mine reads a little bit different but all of his enemies shut down why cuz they heard about how not how they fought they’re better yeah see people might be a match for you they’re not a match for your God here’s the fifth one and I gotta stop here’s the fifth thing that he did that was right that you gotta do he discovered the blessing in the middle of the bed one of the things that happens when you stop flapping your wings and you stop trying to make things happen and you stop pretending like you are God and like you are so in control of your own life as you get blessed beyond measure God took them from the valley of the battle over to the valley of baracan that means the valley of blessing from the valley of the battle to the valley of the blessing God wants to give you so much that you have to share it with other people just imagine that just imagine that for a minute don’t let that go over your head Ino out your ear can you imagine God flipping the script in your life in a 24-hour period I’ve read you the Bible today I this is not my story this is God’s story this is what I’m telling you he flipped that script they got the prophetic word they went to sleep they got some rest then they got up and they got the victory they went from being overwhelmed by the burden to overloaded by the blessing and let me tell you somethin verse 27 can you pull up verse 27 for me in verse 27 the Bible said they were then they returned every man of Judah and Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat in front of them to go back to Jerusalem with joy for the Lord had made them rejoice over their enemies in other words it wasn’t they themselves who got the victory this was hand given to them God did this for them you know there are some battles that when you win you’re so exhausted from the fight because there is a fight that I’m not to fight right out of you there’s some battle you win but you’re like I need time to recover before I can enjoy what I want not this time they got the spoils they went back home rejoicing what was the difference this battle was the Lord’s they didn’t earn it they didn’t fight for it they didn’t beg for it they didn’t buy it all they did was just receive it because when you do those five things y’all got all of them can we put them up just put them up on the screen real quick one two three four five one two three pray about it thank you he focused on God and not the problem he admitted his inability he thanked God in advance and he discovered the blessing in the bad y’all got that come on jump up on your feet all over the building just look at somebody and tell him I’m going after the blessing I’m going after the blessing I’ve had some tough times I’ve been in some tight places but it’s getting rid of shifts because I’m getting a focus on God I’m get rid of call on God and not my neighbor not my friend not my buddy not my mama not I put my daddy I’m getting a call out God and I’m gonna look at bad things and I’m most searched until I find the good things there were dead bodies everywhere they climbed over the bad days and they got the rings off that finger and they got the jewelry off their neck are y’all here at me be careful that you don’t throw away the bad cuz your blessing might be right in the middle of it and sometimes you gotta be willing to say hmm this is a little weird but give me what belongs to me this is mine hear this I got a stop here this right here they didn’t come after the enemy when they got back to their land and realized they had been inhabiting that place God said don’t touch him because there’s a time there’s a time frame be careful what you try to uproot outside of the timing of God hello don’t stir up the devil if you can’t cast him out all that means is you gotta get before God and you got to hear him more clearly but if you will all this overwhelm stuff I want every person that’s been feeling overwhelmed to lift both of your hands right now in this building Father in the name of Jesus I see hands all over this building today I believe that we’ve given you our people this word we’re gonna stand on your word if it worked for Jehoshaphat if it works for Judah it’s gonna work for our us if it worked for their house it’s gonna work for our house so Lord today we just surrender everything to you Lord we lay it all down right here in this room we asked you God for help we admit that we can do it by ourselves we absolutely need you in our lives we praise you in advance for what you’re gonna do we love you we trust you we rest in you and we promised God that we’re not just gonna discount things because they look bad but Lord we’re gonna look into the band and we’re gonna see the blessing that you have appropriated for us well you have blessings put in crazy places but that’s all right God cuz we’re going from being overwhelmed by the battle to being all God to being blessed to living in the valley of the blessing I want everybody to get something I do this periodically because I want to remind you of this I want you to get something in your hand that’s heavy that you don’t mind losing for a moment please don’t grab your iPad or your iPhone because then you’re gonna come back and ask me to pay for it and I’m not paying for it I have a parking lot to pay for that’s that’s my paper but I want you get something heavy get your Bible get your notebook put your wife down sir get something heavy and then move your move yourself a little bit and give yourself some space you’re like space I wish I couldn’t give ["

But RPM/Kent retained many unreleased King masters, and over the years the company released them, thus forcing King to compete with himself.  The most successful of these releases was 'Rock Me Baby,' a blues King wrote with Joe Josea and recorded in about 1958.  The lyric is a basic plea for sex -- 'Rock me all night long' -- while the music provides a blues structure that allows King room for biting guitar work.  'Rock Me Baby' was released as a single on Kent in the spring of 1964 and climbed into the Top 20 of the R&B charts and the Top 40 of the pop charts, making it King's biggest crossover hit yet and his most successful pop record until the appearance of 'The Thrill Is Gone' five and a half years later.  That exposure helped the song become a blues standard, one that was played by many guitarists.  Probably the most radical restatement of 'Rock Me Baby' occurred on June 18, 1967, when the Jimi Hendrix Experience played it at the Monterey International Pop Festival."

Dating from 1BC, the temple would have formed part of the Forum.  Built for Emperor Augustus and made from sandstone from Montjuïc, the temple was discovered in the 15th century, and its origins remained a mystery until the 19th century.  Today, only three columns of the temple remain intact and now form a part of the building.  17- Bunkers del Carmel Another opportunity for visitors to get a birds-eye view of the city of Barcelona is the Bunkers del Carmel.  Built in 1938 as anti-aircraft fortifications to protect the city during the Spanish civil war, the bunkers offer views over the entire city, giving the gunners a strategic advantage.  Following the war, the guns from the bunkers were removed, but their concrete housings were left behind.  In 2000 the bunkers were renovated as more tourists began to flock to the area for its views."

Both the art and architecture from the Islamic world feature vibrant colours and intricate, geometric patterns; much like the kaleidoscopic patterns one can see during a psychedelic experience, either with eyes opened or closed.  During psychedelic experiences, people may report seeing arabesques, which are a fundamental aspect of Islamic art and consist of rhythmic linear patterns of interlacing foliage and spiralling stems.  An arabesque is usually a single design – featuring plant motifs – that is tessellated (or tiled).  Tessellation is when a surface is covered with geometric shapes that fit together in a pattern with no overlaps or gaps.  Some users of DMT have said that the ceilings of world-renowned mosques (such as the Jalil Khayat Mosque in Iraq) bear a striking resemblance to their DMT visions.  But why is there this correspondence between Islamic art and architecture and psychedelia?

Ancient Rocks of Grand Canyon Most rocks in Grand Canyon are sedimentary rocks, which form when sediments such as sand, silt, or mud gather in thick layers that, over time, are compressed into rock.  Grand Canyon’s sedimentary rock layers accumulated over millions of years on the prehistoric surface of northern Arizona, which has been home to giant sand dunes, muddy river deltas, and shallow tropical seas over the past 500 million years.  These environments formed as ancient continents drifted across the globe and ancient oceans advanced and retreated over those continents.  Eventually, eroded sediments from each of these environments formed distinct layers of sedimentary rocks.  Sand dunes were cemented into sandstone, mud was compressed into shale, and the discarded shells of marine animals were cemented together into limestone.  Because Grand Canyon’s rocks were laid down chronologically, one on top of another, they reflect a geological relationship known as superposition.  Simply put, superposition means that the rocks above are younger than the rocks below."

The name of Calabar came to the attention of Albuquerque and the other Portuguese, and, because of his frequent successes, he developed a considerable reputation among them for his cleverness and his treachery.   After a time, the Dutch decided to evacuate Olinda, burn it, and concentrated on Recife.   Section::::External links.   BULLET::::- Albuquerque, Matias De (1595–1647)"

Banking Banking can be traced to the colonial era when banks where established by Colonial masters to serve the needs of the Colonial Government at that time.  Shortly before the country gained independent in July 1959, the Central Bank of Nigeria began operations in the country.  Generally, the banking industry in Nigeria is responsible for holding the financial assets of individuals and businesses.  The banks are also involved in investing these assets to generate more revenue.  Although, the banking industry isn’t exactly responsible for the economic development of the country, it plays an effective and important role.  The industry is particularly known for facilitating financial transaction which helps to promote international and local trade.  Agriculture Once upon a time, agriculture in Nigeria was so vibrant that the revenue from this industry was used to sponsor free education.  Between the 1950s and 1970s, cocoa was a major foreign exchange earner for the country and the profit from cocoa was used to fund free education in Western Nigeria.

These typically hold up well due to the nature of their ingredients — broth doesn't separate or curdle and proteins and vegetables can withstand the moisture well to keep intact.  These soups can last up to three months in the freezer.  What you will want to be wary of is freezing anything with dairy or something cream-based.  These soups can be frozen for one month, tops."

Rice is by far one of the most popular staple food among Nigerians.  Almost every family eats rice daily in Nigeria.  In 2011 alone, Nigeria spent N991billion on rice importation and the rice we import is said to be nothing less than 10 years old in storage.  That means we spent billions buying rice that has since lost its nutritional values.  Any entrepreneur who goes into rice farming and get it right is sure to be smiling to the bank.  A bag of rice is currently sold for N13,000 to N16,000 depending on the quality.  A farmer who is able to invest in large scale rice production in Nigeria and able to produce 100,000 Bags of processed Rice in a year, sell at wholesale price of about N10,000 per bag, he will be making 10,000 x 100,000 = N1,000,000,000 ($3million)  You can achieve the above figures conveniently with less than five hundred and fifty million Naira ($1.5 Million) capital investment."

The method of cooking jollof begins with first preparing the beef or chicken by seasoning and frying it until it is well-cooked The rest of the ingredients are then fried all together, starting from onions, tomatoes and spices in that order.  After all the ingredients have been fried, rice is then added and cooked until the meal is prepared.  Ghanaian jollof is typically served with side dishes of beef, chicken, well-seasoned fried fish, or mixed vegetables.

A 20% down payment is viewed as ideal by lenders because you are investing a significant amount of your own money in your home and therefore the lender’s risk is reduced.  If you make a 20% down payment, you won’t have to pay private mortgage insurance.  PMI provides insurance to the lender in case you default on your loan.  Advantages of a 20% down payment for buyers In addition to eliminating the need for PMI, a 20% down payment on a house will qualify you for a slightly lower interest rate than a borrower who makes a smaller down payment.  Another benefit is that you will borrow less money, making your monthly payments smaller.  In addition, you will instantly have 20% equity in your home, which you can borrow against in the future or get back as part of your profit when you sell.  On the other hand, keep in mind that 20% of the average home price in the nation ($200,000) is $40,000."

You must have very little income or ability to generate income and have liabilities higher than your assets.”  An illness or disability can help make the case.  Hazel Davis, a former IRS agent for 34 years, who also works at McGladrey LLP as a Manager in their Tax Controversy Services practice (part of its Washington National Tax Office), said in her hometown of Greensboro, North Carolina, these mills often hired former IRS agents who would appear in TV ads.  “Taxpayers need to be aware of these scams,” she said.  “They make it sound so easy to get an OIC, but it’s not.

Making a 20% down payment can also help you snag a lower interest rate, thus decreasing your monthly payment and how much you’ll pay in interest over the life of the loan.  Still, there are loan programs that let borrowers make a smaller down payment without incurring PMI, but if you’re going with a conventional loan, 20% is usually ideal.  Evaluate your budget Lenders want reassurance that you’ll be able to make your mortgage payments on time in addition to all of your other financial obligations.  To do this, they determine your debt-to-income ratio.  First, they’ll look at your front-end ratio — your monthly housing payment (including insurance, interest, taxes, and PMI, if applicable) divided by your monthly income.  The general rule of thumb is to keep this at or below 28%.  Next, the lender will look at your back-end ratio, which shows how much of your monthly income goes to service your existing debt (e.g., car loans, student loans, credit card payments)."

The pawn shop will lend an amount equal to a percentage of the item’s value.  Payback windows are short — usually between 30 and 90 days — to pay it back with (oftentimes breathtaking) interest.  Most states have statutes limiting pawnbroker interest rates, although they can range as high as 120% APR.  There are additional problems with add-on fees for service, storage and a lost ticket.  Add-on fees can be more than what you paid in interest charges.  Regardless of any loan, consumers should read the entire agreement, especially the fine print.

Well, the easiest choice is to put it in a bank’s savings account.  A savings account is highly liquid — meaning you can withdraw your money anytime you want.  It is also safe because deposits up to P250,000 are covered by the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation.  If you want higher interest rate than a savings account, you may opt for a time deposit.  Here you park your money for a certain period of time and, in return, the bank offers you an interest rate relatively higher than what your regular savings account will get.  Like a savings account, time deposits are covered by the PDIC up to P250,000 per depositor.  Now, what if you still want a higher interest rate but are not willing to take additional risk?  That’s when you can try investing in Special Deposit Accounts or SDAs.  What are Special Deposit Accounts (SDA)?"

Such confusion is a common element in Ponzi schemes as the orchestrator tries to keep the fraud going and hide what is occurring.  It was true of the fraud committed nearly a century ago by Charles Ponzi, an Italian immigrant in Boston who cheated investors out of $20 million by convincing them that they could make a bundle by buying an obscure type of postal order whose value differed from country to country and redeeming it for a profit in the United States.  Ponzi schemes existed long before they bore Charles Ponzi’s name.  In fact, he got his idea after working at a Montreal bank whose founder had bilked depositors.  Indeed, the Bible refers to endeavors that bear the hallmarks of Ponzi schemes, Antle noted.  It may be no coincidence that they are also called “rob Peter to pay Paul” frauds."

The money they lend is not a conventional mortgage loan that requires licensing.  These types of lenders are typically known as private money lenders or hard money lenders.  These lenders use money from private individuals to fund the loans they are offering.  Since there are no licensing requirements involved in this type of lending, it is much harder to identify a real lender from a scam artist.  The question that you should be asking yourself is how to identify a real lender from a scam?  What are signs to look out for?  One common sign of money lending scams is a lender who is ready to lend you money with little to no questions asked.  Does the lender know about real estate investing?  Can they answer basic questions for you about investing in real estate and lending terms?  Is the lender asking for a large up-front lending fee?  How did you find this lender?  Did you find this lender through social media websites or certified real estate investing websites?  Are the lending terms in the contract too good to be true?  Depending on your answers to these questions, you may have yourself a scam artist."

It is based on a fake investment that one schemer (or group of schemers) gets other people to give money to.  In Ponzi schemes, the schemer basically says, 'I found a great way to make money fast.  The more you give me, the more I can invest in that cause, and the more I can earn for us all'.  But a Ponzi scheme doesn't actually 'earn money'.  Instead, all of the scheme's money comes from the investors.  Once a Ponzi scheme gets too many investors, the system will always crash.  This is because the investors all expect more money than they invested, and they will get impatient.  These schemes always stop one of three ways: The schemer runs away with the money they got.  This is what schemers try to do.  The schemer runs out of money; They will be unable to promise money back right away.  This is called liquidity, and makes investors panic and demand their money back, often all at once."

Ponzi schemes are named after Charles Ponzi.  In the 1920s, Ponzi promised investors a 50% return within a few months for what he claimed was an investment in international mail coupons.  Ponzi used funds from new investors to pay fake “returns” to earlier investors.  Ponzi scheme organizers often promise high returns with little or no risk.  Instead, they use money from new investors to pay earlier investors and may steal some of the money for themselves.  With little or no legitimate earnings, Ponzi schemes require a constant flow of new money to survive.  When it becomes hard to recruit new investors, or when large numbers of existing investors cash out, these schemes tend to collapse.  Learn more"

In 1880s Boston, Sarah Howe offered female investors a chance to make money in the Ladies Deposit.  She garnered half a million dollars from more than a thousand women, using some of the funds to pay off other investors and pocketing the rest.  A couple of decades later, William Franklin Miller came along and tried the scheme again to even bigger success.  He promised unheard-of returns, and when he came through on his promises, more investors poured in, handing over a million dollars in total before he was exposed [  source: Zuckoff ].  In Miller's case, the victims were so thrilled by the success of their investments that they chose to reinvest their earnings in his scheme [  source: Zuckoff ].  Clearly, Ponzi wasn't the first to implement the scheme, and he wasn't the last -- not by a long shot.  Since his stunt in 1920, many Ponzi schemes have been exposed around the world.

Get started today » One of the concerns I’ve seen aimed at Bitcoin is the claim that it’s a Ponzi scheme.  The argument suggests that because the Bitcoin network is continually reliant on new people buying in, that eventually it will collapse in price as new buyers are exhausted.  So, this article takes a serious look at the concern by comparing and contrasting Bitcoin to systems that have Ponzi-like characteristics, to see if the claim holds up.  The short answer is that Bitcoin does not meet the definition of a Ponzi scheme in either narrow or broad sense, but let’s dive in to see why that’s the case.  Defining a Ponzi Scheme To start with tackling the topic of Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme, we need a definition.  Here is how the US Securities and Exchange Commission defines one: A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors.  Ponzi scheme organizers often promise to invest your money and generate high returns with little or no risk.  But in many Ponzi schemes, the fraudsters do not invest the money.  Instead, they use it to pay those who invested earlier and may keep some for themselves."

Initially a promising young actress, Spitzeder became a well-known private banker in 19th-century Munich when her theatrical success dwindled.  Running what was possibly the first recorded Ponzi scheme, she offered large returns on investments by continually using the money of new investors to pay back the previous ones.  At the height of her success, Spitzeder was estimated to be the wealthiest woman in Bavaria.   Opening her bank in 1869, Spitzeder managed to fend off attempts to discredit her for a few years before authorities were able to bring her to trial in 1872.  Because Ponzi schemes were not yet illegal, she was convicted instead of bad accounting and mishandling customers' money and sentenced to three years in prison.  Her bank was closed and 32,000 people lost 38 million gulden, the equivalent of almost 400 million euros in 2017 money, causing a wave of suicides.  Her personal fortune in art and cash was stripped from her.   After her release from prison in 1876, Spitzeder was no longer employable and left Germany, but she returned in 1878 to publish her memoir."

The typical investment fraud schemes are characterized by offers of low- or no-risk investments, guaranteed returns, overly-consistent returns, complex strategies, or unregistered securities.  These schemes often seek to victimize affinity groups—such as groups with a common religion or ethnicity—to utilize the common interests to build trust to effectively operate the investment fraud against them.  The perpetrators range from professional investment advisers to persons trusted and interacted with daily, such as a neighbor or sports coach.  The fraudster’s ability to foster trust makes these schemes so successful.

According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), many Ponzi schemes share similar characteristics that should be 'red flags' for investors.  The warning signs include:  BULLET::::- High investment returns with little or no risk.  Every investment carries some degree of risk, and investments yielding higher returns typically involve more risk.  Any 'guaranteed' investment opportunity is often considered suspicious.   BULLET::::- Overly consistent returns.  Investment values tend to go up and down over time, especially those offering potentially high returns.  An investment that continues to generate regular positive returns regardless of overall market conditions is considered suspicious.   BULLET::::- Unregistered investments.  Ponzi schemes typically involve investments that have not been registered with the SEC or with state regulators.  Registration is important because it provides investors with access to key information about the company's management, products, services, and finances.   BULLET::::- Unlicensed sellers.  Federal and state securities laws require that investment professionals and their firms be licensed or registered.  Most Ponzi schemes involve unlicensed individuals or unregistered firms.

In particular, they describe a sustainability problem that they say happens when the number of new contributors declines.  William G. Shipman of the Cato Institute argues: In common usage a trust fund is an estate of money and securities held in trust for its beneficiaries.  The Social Security Trust Fund is quite different.  It is an accounting of the difference between tax and benefit flows.  When taxes exceed benefits, the federal government lends itself the excess in return for an interest-paying bond, an IOU that it issues to itself.  The government then spends its new funds on unrelated projects such as bridge repairs, defense, or food stamps.  The funds are not invested for the benefit of present or future retirees.  This criticism is not new.  In his 1936 presidential campaign, Republican Alf Landon called the trust fund 'a cruel hoax'."

Francis denied the charges.)  But Francis also seems to be an opponent of austerity, most notably during his time as spiritual leader of Argentina when the country defaulted on its debt in 2002.  A paper by Thomas Trebat, 'Argentina, the Church, and Debt,' details the church's role in the crisis's resolution.  Argentine bishops, including Francis, had long criticized the laissez-faire policies of Carlos Menem, who was president from 1989 to 1999.  'The bishops were critical of the economic model as a generator of poverty and unemployment, notwithstanding the stability it had brought to the country,' Trebat wrote.

23787,142_3-5,0,KILT_30864554-22,0,"The social aspects of clothing have revolved around traditions regarding certain items of clothing intrinsically suited different gender roles. In different periods, both women's and men's fashions have highlighted one area or another of the body for attention.  In particular, the wearing of skirts and trousers has given rise to common phrases expressing implied restrictions in use and disapproval of offending behavior.  For example, ancient Greeks often considered the wearing of trousers by Persian men as a sign of an effeminate attitude.  Women's clothing in Victorian fashion was used as a means of control and admiration.  Reactions to the elaborate confections of French fashion led to various calls for reform on the grounds of both beauties (Artistic and Aesthetic dress) and health (dress reform; especially for undergarments and lingerie).  Although trousers for women did not become fashionable until the later 20th century, women began wearing men's trousers (suitably altered) for outdoor work a hundred years earlier.  In the 1960s, André Courrèges introduced long trousers for women as a fashion item, leading to the era of the pantsuit and designer jeans, and the gradual eroding of the prohibitions against girls and women wearing trousers in schools, the workplace, and fine restaurants.  Corsets have long been used for fashion, and body modification, such as waistline reduction."

One reason that dress is important for men is that it projects social status; women who reject a man in a Burger King uniform might be willing to date someone in medical scrubs.  The quality of non-work clothing also conveys an impression about where a person shops and their disposable income.  Women are attracted to other signs of high social status, from elite diction to driving an expensive car, or dining at a posh restaurant (3).  Perhaps, for this reason, many still prefer if the man pays the expenses of a date.  In our society, this is a sign of having disposable income and being generous enough to dispose of it.  Even in societies that did not use money, men were expected to bring gifts when they courted.  This practice bears analogy with the nuptial gifts of birds and insects where the female is lulled into a sense of security by getting a morsel to eat.  The act of generosity is invariably by the male.  This fits in with Bateman's Principle according to which males are more eager to mate and therefore must do something to win over the female."

Here are some key ones: Like most South American countries, Argentina is home to a macho society.  This means catcalling, regularly and frequently from almost all men.  If you’re walking alone this is likely to occur.  Ignore it, and it will become background noise.  If you feel uncomfortable in a situation, feel that you’re in danger, or feel threatened by someone, move towards a public place, a shop, tourist police – find help.  Don’t walk around sketchy streets after dark e.g. parks, shortcuts down alleyways, all the usual stuff.  Just be careful and think, “Would I walk through a place like this at home?”  If in doubt get an Uber home.  Often the safer option.  Taxis aren’t always great for solo women travellers, in both Argentina and the whole world for that matter."

Argentina is the sixth largest wine producing country by volume, so these opportunities abound.  You can enjoy an aromatic Torrontes in Salta, a classic Cabernet Sauvignon in the north, or a meaty Mendoza Malbec in the central region of the country.  Many Argentine wineries offer wine tours and tastings.  02 of 10 Iguazú Falls Grant Ordelheide/Getty Images 'Poor Niagara!'  These were the words Eleanor Roosevelt reportedly said when she visited Iguazú Falls for the first time.  The term 'Iguazú' means 'great waters' in the Guarani language.  The falls were established in 1984 as a Natural World Heritage Site by UNESCO.  Along with Nahuel Huapi National Park in Patagonia, Iguazú Falls is among the most frequented tourist sites in Argentina, and for good reason.  Visitors can enjoy the awe-inspiring views of the falls along with tours, treks, and water sports at the falls' base."

Many foragers are told not to bother with pheasant’s back mushrooms, also known as dryad’s saddles.  While it’s undisputed that they are edible (as in non-poisonous), many experienced foragers will tell you that they’re tough, chewy and not worth the bother.  This is their loss, as these mushrooms are quite good if you know how to treat them and when they’re best.  Forager Chef explains: The dryad saddle is a very firm mushroom.  I’ve heard of people eating it and not liking it, and saying it is inedible.  I have also heard people praise it for being delicious.  The confusing part is that both are right, It just depends on at what age you happen to find the mushroom.  You wouldn’t want to eat the stem of asparagus when it’s old and woody, although you could make soup with them.  The Dryad Saddle is the same way."

Many meat dishes are cooked in tomatoes and red wine and others in lemon such as lamb fricasse, which is lamb cooked with endives or romaine lettuce and an egg-lemon sauce.  Garlic is used heavily as are onions and potatoes in the many stews and oven baked dishes.  There is a pork dish similar to fricasse which is made with celery and served in the winter called hirino me celino.  Dolmades(stuffed grape leaves),kolokithia gemista, (stuffed zuchinni), tomates ke peperies gemista (stuffed tomatoes and peppers) and laxano gemista(stuffed cabbage) are other examples of stretching the meat by using it with rice and vegetables.

Human habitation of the region dates back thousands of years, with some early archaeological findings in the area dated to at least the 13th millennium BC, although later dates around the 10th millennium BC are more securely recognized.  Evidence exists of human activity at Monte Verde in Llanquihue Province, Chile, dated to around 12,500 BC.  The glacial-period ice fields and subsequent large meltwater streams would have made settlement difficult at that time.   The region seems to have been inhabited continuously since 10,000 BC, by various cultures and alternating waves of migration, the details of which are as yet poorly understood.  Several sites have been excavated, notably caves such as Cueva del Milodon in Última Esperanza in southern Patagonia, and Tres Arroyos on Tierra del Fuego, that support this date.  Hearths, stone scrapers, animal remains dated to 9400–9200 BC have been found east of the Andes.   The Cueva de las Manos is a famous site in Santa Cruz, Argentina.

Beyond simply picking the 'best' restaurants in Brazil, it's important to know how to eat in Rio, with respect to finding the right type of restaurants for each meal. 01 of 10 Pao de Queijo Marcelo Peri/Creative RM Traditionally, Brazilians eat a light and simple breakfast, opting for a slice of toasted bread with jam, butter, Minas cheese, fruit, and an espresso.  Another popular breakfast item is the pao de queijo, a stuffed bread roll made from tapioca flour and filled with melted cheese.  You can find the pao de queijo throughout Rio, but the most famous franchise is Casa de Pao de Queijo where the pao de queijo always tastes flaky and hot.  But, American and European tourists generally prefer a heartier breakfast, leading a few Brazilian restaurants to launch American-style bakeries or brunch options.  Gringo Cafe directly caters to that demographic, offering up traditional American breakfast dishes like pancakes, waffles, and omelets.  Or, try Bakers which serves sandwiches, quiches, and plenty of pastries to fill the stomach."

Central region and la Pampa Typical pizzeria from Buenos Aires.  Argentine Puchero For long periods, urban areas such as Buenos Aires, Rosario, and Córdoba welcomed European immigrants, including, above all, those of Italian and Spanish descent.  Nevertheless, there was also a migratory flow of German, Swiss, and Middle-Eastern immigrants arriving in Argentina.  Among the countless changes this melting pot brought was the enrichment of culinary art.  Dishes such as pasta, pizza, pucheros ( stews ), croquetas ( fritters ), sauces, embutidos ( sausages ), and chicken and meat courses brought a wider scope of options to daily menus.  Furthermore, the bread-making, dessert, pastry, and dairy industries have achieved considerable development in this region.

Argentineans love beef.  In fact in Buenos Aires many locals eat beef a dozen times a week.  So great is their respect for this noble meat that no Argentinean would ever dream of marinating it or of seasoning it with anything other than salt.  Still, two condiments are commonly served with grilled meats: a gusty parsley-garlic sauce called chimichurri and a robust relish called salsa criolla.  The former is a cross between pesto and vinaigrette, made with fragrant fresh flat-leaf parsley and a nose-blasting dose of garlic.  (Don't worry about bad breath: the parsley acts as a breath freshener.)  Salsa criolla combines tomatoes, onions and peppers.As in North America, a typical Argentinean steak house would serve baked potatoes or french fries.  But at least one Buenos Aires restuarant—Las Naszarenas—also offers a sort of pan-fried potato-onion frittata called Tortilla Española."

Merienda is important to the Filipinos because they find the gap between lunch and  dinner too long, and they need to take many breaks from the intense  tropical heat.  Lumpia (spring rolls), puto (little cupcakes made from ground rice), and panyo-panyo (tiny pastry envelopes filled with mango and banana jam) are a few merienda dishes.  Anything can be served with the snack except steamed rice.   Steamed rice constitutes a complete meal, which merienda is not considered.  6 POLITICS, ECONOMICS, AND NUTRITION About 22 percent of the population of the Philippines are classified as  undernourished by the World Bank.

Argentina has overcome its unstable political and economic past, and its steady economy and peaceful political state make it a very attractive expat destination.  People from almost 80 different countries can enter Argentina without a visa, provided that they are staying for a period of under 90 days.  If you are planning on working while there or staying longer, however, you must apply for a visa of temporary residency.  European emigrants have been moving to Argentina ever since Spanish colonial rule in South America.  As a typical “immigration nation,” it originally attracted just the Spanish, but in the 19 th century Italian migrants started arriving too.  In the years between 1870 and 1930, estimates suggest that 7 million people from mostly Spain and Italy made the move to Argentina.  An Ethnically Diverse, Cosmopolitan Nation Nowadays, Argentines of Spanish or Italian descent make up the biggest groups among the populace, and only 3% of the population identify as Amerindians or mestizos (mixed-race).

Contents 1 History 2 Tea production 3 Yerba mate 4 Tea-drinking customs and establishments 5 References History When Jesuit missionaries first came to Argentina, they tried to ban the popular indigenous tea, yerba maté, out of concern about its addictive qualities.  They ultimately reversed their stance and began cultivating yerba maté on plantations in the Misiones province in particular (and elsewhere in South America), until the expulsion of the religious order from the Americas in 1767 during the Suppression of the Society of Jesus.  The first varieties of non-native tea to be grown in colonial Argentina were introduced from Russia in 1920.  Beginning in 1924, the Argentine government urged farmers to experiment by planting tea seeds that the government imported from China and then distributed to interested farmers."

This awe-inspiring site can be humbling – a crucial reaction if we want to protect our planet and enjoy this natural beauty for, hopefully, millennia to come.  Here are ways to access the falls from the three bordering countries.  Paraguay Coming from Paraguay, you will have to cross into either Brazil or Argentina to view the falls, with the former being the simplest option.  If you are coming from the capital, Asunción, you will need to make your way to the popular border town of Ciudad del Este.  From Ciudad del Este, frequent minibuses and taxis ferry you over the very lackadaisical border.  You then have the option to visit for the day and return to Paraguay, or move on and continue your trip through Brazil or Argentina.  Brazil All major cities in the southern portion of Brazil offer direct busses to Iguazu, but to avoid an enormously lengthy journey, the easiest hub to use is the state capital of Curitiba.  From there, a comfortable 10-hour overnight bus will drop you right in the center of Foz do Iguacu, the Brazilian town adjacent to the waterfall.  Argentina If you are heading to Puerto Iguazu from within Argentina, you have two options."

Located on the Iguacu river and situated on the territory of two countries.  Brazilian Iguacu Falls, in Portuguese Cataratas do Iguaçu, lie in the Paraná province.  Argentinian Iguazu Falls, in Spanish Cataratas del Iguazú, lie in the province of Misiones.  It’s good to consider visiting both sides of the falls as each of them offers different but still fascinating views.  Waterfalls were first recorded by a Spanish conquistador Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca in 1541.  Today the falls are a UNESCO heritage.  Together with waterfalls there are two national parks formed by a rainforest under protection.  Going on a tour in the national park means meeting animals like butterflies, toucans, parrots, caymans, monkeys or raccoons and jaguars in their natural environment.  Iguaçu Falls in Brazil It’s very easy to get on the Brazilian side of the falls from Foz do Iguacu.  That’s the place where we stayed.  Foz is a small city in Brazil but for us it was still quite big.  Beyond the falls there are more places to visit."

After The Great French Wine Blight, many vines were left devastated; the remaining crops took a another large hit during the 1950’s when a heavy frost killed nearly ¾’s of the Malbec crop in France, which led to a decrease in the grapes use and popularity in France.  The vine rootstocks were transported to New World regions like Argentina in an effort to invigorate the vine's production.  Wines made with Malbec grapes are balanced, smooth and very drinkable with a well-rounded mouthfeel.  The Malbec grape develops widely different flavors depending on where it is grown; when grown in France it has pronounced leathery flavors and flavors of currant, black plum and can be quite bitter, while Malbec grapes grown in Argentina have pronounced fruit flavors of plum, cherry and blackberry, chocolate, floral and hints of leather.  The differences in the characteristics of Malbec grapes grown in different regions explains why the grapes are used so differently in wine making in each region, with Malbec being part of a blend in France and used solely to make a 100% varietal wine in Argentina."

Pasilla de Oaxaca Chile Pronounced 'Pah-SEE-yah day Waa-HAAK-kah,' this chile is not well known in the United States but it is gaining some popularity among serious chile heads.  Most people in the US are more familiar with the smoked chipotle, also called smoked jalapenos, but the Pasilla Oaxaca possesses a bit less heat than the chipotle and twice the smokiness.  It is in the hilly region of Oaxaca in southern Mexico that these long pasilla chilles are smoked.  These chiles are popular in vegetarian dishes for their rich smokiness that brings out a bacony ham flavor without the addition of any meat.  Also used in the famous 'mole negro', Latin style bean dishes, soups, sauces and in a regional favorite – rellenos.  Tasmanian Pepperberry This spice is used primarily in Australia's bushfood, which are foods from local cuisines that have gained mainstream popularity in recent years."

But as the population expanded, it became necessary to add descriptive information to distinguish between individuals of the same name.  Also, in the past, the first born babies were named after their parents.  But today, parents focus on uniqueness and distinctiveness of the name.  They pick names that are fashionable, trendy, and unique.  So it’s common to name children after sports, political, and pop culture celebs.  In earlier times, baby names needed to be Spanish as Argentina is largely a Spanish speaking country.  If parents wanted a name of a different ethnicity or language for their children, they needed to seek permission from the Government.  But this rule has now been relaxed.  There are still some conditions pertaining to baby names, but that’s to stop parents from picking weird and unusual names that can affect the child in later life.  Additionally, it was mandatory for married women to take their husband’s name.  But the law now allows women to use their maiden name.

Opening a euro-denominated bank account is essential if you travel or work in Europe.  The European Union has 27 member countries, of which 16 have adopted the euro as their currency.  You benefit from being able to use your credit and debit cards in any of the 16 countries without concerns about exchange rates and associated charges.  ATM withdrawals are usually free.  The euro is also widely accepted in European countries that haven't adopted the euro.  U.S. citizens can open a euro bank account as the U.S. government doesn't impose restrictions.  However, the Internal Revenue Service does require you to declare assets in a euro bank account if the amount deposited exceeds the currency equivalent of $10,000.  You should also declare dividend and interest payments credited to your euro account.  Step 1 Choose one of the 16 European countries to open a euro bank account (see Resources).  Select one of the major countries; it is likely to have a branch in the U.S. It makes it easier to open and manage your euro bank account."

The EBF is an obvious dialogue partner for the European institutions in laying out this legislation.   Furthermore, the role of the Federation as the united voice of all EU banks has naturally led it to be a forum where members' initiatives are proposed and debated.  Meetings are arranged on matters of concern to the whole European banking sector, specialised Working Groups and Committees analyse specific questions and propose solutions, leading to the publication of reports or position papers.   Finally, the role of the Federation is by no means limited to European matters.

The US Federal Reserve has been conducting open market operations since the 1920s through the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The European Central Bank (ECB) says that the Eurosystem’s regular open market operations consist of: – Main Refinancing Operations: also known as MROs.  These are one-week liquidity-providing operations in euros.  They serve to steer interest rates over the short term, to signal the monetary policy stance in the euro zone, and to manage the liquidity situation.  – Longer-Term Refinancing Operations: also known as LTROs.  These are three-month liquidity-providing operations in euros.  They serve to provide additional financing to the financial sector over the long term.  In an article published online by the International Monetary Fund – Transformations to Open Market Operations – Stephen H. Axilrod writes: “By buying or selling bonds, bills, and other financial instruments in the open market, a central bank can expand or contract the amount of reserves in the banking system and can ultimately influence the country’s money supply.  When the central bank sells such instruments it absorbs money from the system.”  “Conversely, when it buys it injects money into the system."

He was unable to get the bank dissolved, but refused to renew its charter.  Jackson attempted to counteract this by executive order requiring all Federal land payments to be made in gold or silver.  This produced the Panic of 1837.   Section::::1837–1862: 'Free Banking' Era.   In this period, only state-chartered banks existed.  They could issue bank notes against specie (gold and silver coins) and the states heavily regulated their own reserve requirements, interest rates for loans and deposits, the necessary capital ratio etc.  These banks had existed since 1781, in parallel with the Banks of the United States.  The Michigan Act (1837) allowed the automatic chartering of banks that would fulfill its requirements without special consent of the state legislature.  This legislation made creating unstable banks easier by lowering state supervision in states that adopted it.  The real value of a bank bill was often lower than its face value, and the issuing bank's financial strength generally determined the size of the discount.  By 1797 there were 24 chartered banks in the U.S.; with the beginning of the 'Free Banking Era' (1837) there were 712."

One in five consumers find open banking valuable, 14 with the interest higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation (figure 1).  Nearly one-half of Gen Z respondents and 39 percent of millennials see value in open banking, in contrast to only 23 percent or fewer of older respondents.  This generational difference could be an important factor for bank leaders to consider as they pursue open banking strategies.  Our previous research 15 on digital banking, as well as our current survey, indicates that younger consumers tend to use more savings, payments, and budgeting apps, a behavior correlated with interest in open banking.  The main reasons more younger consumers said they were in favor of open banking were “flexibility and transparency” and making things “less of a hassle.”  But, generally, consumers are most interested in services that make financial management easier, such as being able to compare bank services, integrate financial data, and personalize budgeting tools."

Expansion of Open Banking More and more regulatory bodies globally are requiring banking organizations to enable customers to share their data securely with third parties to power new financial services and increase competition in the banking industry.

Open banking APIs accelerate innovation and collaboration, leading to expanded banking ecosystems that could include more than just financial services to make a consumer’s lifestyle better.  What is exciting about open banking is that making consumer consent a central part of open banking strategy places an increased emphasis on consumer value propositions.

Application Programming Interface management, or API management, consists of a set of tools and services that enable developers and companies to build, analyze, operate, and scale APIs in secure environments.  API management can be delivered on-premises, through the cloud, or using a hybrid on-premises – SaaS (Software as a Service) approach.  At their simplest level, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) enable communication between disparate software applications.  Developers can connect APIs from different companies and services to achieve specific results.  Popular API uses include enabling the implementation of libraries and frameworks across languages, specifying the interface between an application and an operating system, manipulating remote resources through protocols, and defining the interface through which interactions happen between a third-party and the applications that use its assets.  From independent mobile developers and web developers to large enterprises and governmental agencies, APIs are increasingly leveraged across industries and use cases.  Today, developers, enterprises, and organizations often create open APIs that allow others to integrate with their products and services."

The banking relationship will allow the exchanges’ crypto customers to complete withdrawals, wire transfers and deposits to and from Coinbase and Gemini, establishing a critical bridge for the digital asset ecosystem.  Although Bitcoin is censorship-resistant and is not controlled by governments, central banks or central authorities, the network needs participation from major financial institutions in order to reach mass adoption.  Without bridges in place that allow customers to link their bank accounts to a cryptocurrency exchange, enabling smooth and rapid transfers, the reach of digital assets could remain limited in scope.  Both Coinbase and Gemini have focused on developing strong regulatory frameworks that ultimately allowed them to pass a strict vetting process on the road to approval by the banking giant.  The JPMorgan Chase turning point, at least at the outset, lessens the argument that Bitcoin will effectively be stamped out by choking off crucial access points: primarily traditional banks that allow dollars to be converted into BTC and other cryptocurrencies.  As more dollars flow into the cryptosphere and as digital assets become more entrenched in the financial system, the more likely it is that Bitcoin and its cousin coins can survive and thrive."

These classes are called derived class.  The main advantage of using this concept of inheritance in Object oriented programming is it helps in reducing the code size since the common characteristic is placed separately called as base class and it is just referred in the derived class.  This provide the users the important usage of terminology called as reusability Reusability: This usage is achieved by the above explained terminology called as inheritance.  Reusability is nothing but re- usage of structure without changing the existing one but adding new features or characteristics to it.  It is very much needed for any programmers in different situations.  Reusability gives the following advantages to users It helps in reducing the code size since classes can be just derived from existing one and one need to add only the new features and it helps users to save their time.

In terms of feeding propellants to the combustion chamber, liquid-propellant engines are either pressure-fed or pump-fed, and pump-fed engines work in either a gas-generator cycle, a staged-combustion cycle, or an expander cycle .  A liquid rocket engine can be tested prior to use, whereas for a solid rocket motor a rigorous quality management must be applied during manufacturing to ensure high reliability.  A Liquid rocket engine can also usually be reused for several flights, as in the Space Shuttle and Falcon 9 series rockets, although reuse of solid rocket motors was also effectively demonstrated during the shuttle program.  Bipropellant liquid rockets are simple in concept but due to high temperatures and high speed moving parts, very complex in practice.  Use of liquid propellants can be associated with a number of issues: Because the propellant is a very large proportion of the mass of the vehicle, the center of mass shifts significantly rearward as the propellant is used; one will typically lose control of the vehicle if its center mass gets too close to the center of drag/pressure."

The idea of maternal care was developed during the 1950s, starting from two different, if overlapping, areas.  The first was a concern with the fact that the mother's extended absence — the effective loss of the mother — could lead to a depressive response on the part of the child (Spitz, 1946), to anxiety reactions, or to developmental delays.  The term was used in the same sense but in a somewhat more official way in John Bowlby 's report to the World Health Organization (1951), which provided a critical review of clinical studies and research on the harmful results of deficiencies in maternal care.  Bowlby's monograph precipitated major changes in the practices of institutions and childcare centers in many countries."

The company SpaceX is developing the technologies over a number of years to facilitate full and rapid reusability of space launch vehicles.  The project's long-term objectives include returning a launch vehicle first stage to the launch site in minutes and to return a second stage to the launch pad following orbital realignment with the launch site and atmospheric reentry in up to 24 hours.  SpaceX's long term goal is that both stages of their orbital launch vehicle will be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return.   The program was publicly announced in 2011.  SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015.  The first re-flight of a landed first stage occurred in March 2017 with the second occurring in June 2017, that one only five months after the maiden flight of the booster.  The third attempt occurred in October 2017 with the SES-11/EchoStar-105 mission.  Second flights of refurbished first stages then became routine.

As the satellites headed on their way Wednesday, the booster rocket began its descent toward the ocean for a landing on a special floating platform.  Video footage of the attempt seemed to show the booster touching down, then flames, before the picture froze.  As with previous attempts, SpaceX had said landing the reusable booster rocket would be made more difficult by the fact that it would be falling from higher up.  And, the company said, the rocket would have less fuel than normal to control its descent.  SpaceX founder Elon Musk later tweeted that it appeared the the thrust in one of three landing engines was insufficient, causing the rocket to come in far too fast.  In what he said may have been SpaceX's 'hardest impact' ever, the booster ultimately suffered an RUD, or 'rapid unscheduled disassembly.'

At room temperature butane is colourless and odourless and flammable.  Butane is used in gas cylinders for cooking, mainly with camping items for use in tent or caravan.  Butane is also utilised in a mixture with propane as a fuel in cigarette lighters.  Further butane is used in gas cylinders used by roofers and plumbers.  Because the boiling point of butane is -0,5 degrees, Celsius butane will be liquid with temperatures lower than -0,5 degrees Celsius.  Therefore propane is more useful as fuel for cooking.

Rocket engines The biggest (and arguably the most interesting) part of a rocket is the propulsion system—the engine that powers it into the sky.  As we've already seen, rockets differ from jet planes (and other fuel-powered vehicles that work on Earth) because they have to carry their own oxygen supply.  Modern space rockets have main engines powered by a liquid fuel (such as liquid hydrogen) and liquid oxygen (which does the same job as the air sucked into a car engine) that are pumped in from huge tanks.  The fuel (also called the propellant) and oxygen  (called the oxidizer) are stored at low temperatures and high pressures so more can be carried in tanks of a certain size, which means the rocket can go further on the same volume of fuel.  External rocket boosters that assist a main rocket engine typically burn solid fuel instead  (the Space Shuttle's were called solid rocket boosters, or SRBs, for exactly that reason)."

Hydrogen internal combustion engine development has been receiving more interest recently, particularly for heavy duty commercial vehicles.  Part of the motivation for this is as a bridging technology to meet future climate CO2 emission goals, and as technology more compatible with existing automotive knowledge and manufacturing.  Efficiency Since hydrogen internal combustion engines are heat engines, their maximum efficiency is limited by the Carnot efficiency.  In comparison, the efficiency of a fuel cell is limited by the Gibbs free energy, which is typically higher than that of Carnot.  Hydrogen combustion engines are particularly sensitive to transients in load, in terms of efficiency, and therefore more suited to constant load operations.  Pollutant emissions The combustion of hydrogen with oxygen produces water vapor as its only product: 2H 2 + O 2 → 2H 2 O However, within air hydrogen combustion can produce oxides of nitrogen, known as NO x. In this way, the combustion process is much like other high temperature combustion fuels, such as kerosene, gasoline, diesel or natural gas.  As such hydrogen combustion engines are not considered zero emission .  Hydrogen has a wide flammability range in comparison with other fuels.  As a result, it can be combusted in an internal combustion engine over a wide range of fuel-air mixtures."

Solid rocket engines are used on air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, on model rockets , and as boosters for satellite launchers.  In a solid rocket, the fuel and oxidizer are mixed together into a solid propellant which is packed into a solid cylinder.  A hole through the cylinder serves as a combustion chamber .  When the mixture is ignited, combustion takes place on the surface of the propellant.  A flame front is generated which burns into the mixture.  The combustion produces great amounts of exhaust gas at high temperature and pressure .  The amount of exhaust gas that is produced depends on the area of the flame front and engine designers use a variety of hole shapes to control the change in thrust for a particular engine.  The hot exhaust gas is passed through a nozzle which accelerates the flow.  Thrust is then produced according to Newton's third law of motion.  The amount of thrust produced by the rocket depends on the design of the nozzle .  The smallest cross-sectional area of the nozzle is called the throat of the nozzle."

Asked by: Sameer Singla Answer Both a jet engine and a rocket engine function by expelling hot gases opposite to the direction of desired acceleration.  Newton's third law of motion says that the action of the hot gases produces a reaction in the opposite direction on the jet or rocket propelled vehicle; the momentum imparted to the gases is exactly opposite to the momentum imparted to the vehicle.  The main difference between the two types of engine is that a rocket carries its own supply of oxygen for combustion.  A jet engine requires oxygen from the atmosphere for combustion, and so cannot operate in the vacuum of space.  Answered by: Paul Walorski, B.A., Part Time Physics/Astronomy Instructor BR> Answer Well, one is an airplane, and the other is a rocket!  That's quite a difference in my opinion!  Joking aside, there are serious differences between the working principles of a jet airplane and a rocket.  (The differences in detail are much greater I guess, but I am just a physicist.)

Liquid rockets tend to be heavier and more complex because of the pumps used to move the fuel and oxidizer, and you usually load the fuel and oxidizer into the rocket just before launch.  A solid rocket is much easier to handle and can sit for years before firing.  The relative safety of building and flying model rockets is the result of the production and availability of pre-packaged solid model rocket engines.  The engines are produced by several manufacturers and are available in a variety of sizes with a range of engine performance.  The engines can be bought at most hobby stores and some toy stores for a modest price (average current price is 3 engines for $5).  The engines are used once and discarded; a new engine is inserted into the rocket for the next flight.  Before these engines became available, many young rocket builders lost limbs or life in the process of mixing rocket fuels.

His third law states that for every action (force) in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction.  In other words, if object A exerts a force on object B, then object B also exerts an equal and opposite force on object A. Notice that the forces are exerted on different objects.  In aerospace engineering, the principal of action and reaction is very important.  Newton's third law explains the generation of thrust by a rocket engine.  In a rocket engine, hot exhaust gas is produced through the combustion of a fuel with an oxidizer.  The hot exhaust gas flows through the rocket nozzle and is accelerated to the rear of the rocket.

For a reusable Falcon 9, it is around Mach 6, depending on the mission.”  For their reusable rocket this means the lower and upper stage separation needs to happen earlier, which puts a lot of extra strain on the upper stage – this translates in less cargo handling capabilities since each stage needs more fuel, first to be able to fly back on their own to the launch side and second to compensate for the earlier separation.  Still, if you have enough of these rockets and launch them often enough, this will greatly compensate.  Practically, if you could use ONE Falcon Heavy rocket a hundred times in a year, it would become economically feasible extremely fast – you’re only expense launch to launch is fuel, staff and other miscellaneous expenses; trivial really when compared to having to build an entire rocket from scratch every new launch."

The LS1 engine is the newer design that replaced the older LT1 engines.  The main difference between the LS1 and LT1 engines is the material used in the block.  LT1 engines were made out of cast iron while the LS1 engine blocks were made out of aluminum, except those made for trucks, which are still made out of cast iron for optimal strength and durability.  The change in metal used has distinct effects on how the engines perform.  The LS1 engines are much lighter compared to the LT1 engines, and in vehicles, reducing the weight always relates to better performance.  The aluminum block of the LS1 engine is also much better in dissipating heat compared to the cast iron block of the LT1.  This lets the engine achieve a higher compression without worrying about overheating the engine due to excessive heat.  Because of this and a variety of other factors, the LS1 engines produce more power than LT1 engines.  The LT1 engines produced prior to the release of the LS1 engines were rated at 260 hp, while the LS1 engine debuted at 345 hp and gradually increased over the years."

Steam clouds, the product of the SLS main engines’ hydrogen-oxygen reaction, pour from an RS-25 engine during testing at NASA’s Stennis Space Center.  The RS-25 main engines are called “liquid engines” because the fuel is liquid hydrogen (LH2).  Liquid oxygen (LOX) serves as the oxidizer.

Here’s what you need to know about this worldwide disaster.  1.  CORALS ARE ANIMALS.  A coral reef in the Red Sea near Obhor, north of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.  Image credit: Hassan Ammar / AFP/Getty Images Thousands of species of coral exist, and hundreds of those are hard or reef-building corals.  These individual coral animals, called polyps, look sort of like miniature sea anemones—a soft, tubular body topped by a ring of tentacles.  Each builds a hard, protective external skeleton of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) around its base.  Thousands together make up a reef, with each polyp connected to the next by a thin layer of tissue.  Reefs grow when polyps periodically lift off their base and secrete a new one, adding layers of calcium.  Sexual and asexual reproduction also increase the size of reefs by increasing the number of individual polyps.  Reef growth varies from 2 centimeters (0.8 inches) or less per year for massive corals up to 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) per year for branching corals."

Coral reefs provide an estimated US$ 375 billion per year in goods and services to the world.  This includes support for marine fisheries, which provide the principal protein source for many island populations, especially amongst SIDS.  Yet island biodiversity is not only of vital importance to island dwellers.

This biodiversity has an inherent value to humankind the world over."
33751,145_1-1,0,MARCO_27_458288546-3,0,"Coral organisms can also reproduce through an asexual method called fragmentation where the coral simply fragments or breaks and is re-settled somewhere else. This can happened naturally, by outside force, or for growing purposes.  The sexual part of the reproductive coral is naturally a bit more complicated as sexual reproduction is fundamentally more complex than asexual reproduction.  While each coral species is unique, the majority of stony coral species produce male and/or female gametes.  That’s right: some corals will produce both male and female gametes depending on conditions.  Most species of coral are broadcast spawners, meaning that each coral releases massive numbers of male (sperm) and female (egg) gametes into the water in order to distribute their offspring throughout the water.  As one can imagine, the timing of these mass spawning events must be timed perfectly and synchronized to be successful due to the stationary nature of mature corals.  The goal is for the egg and sperm from the individual corals to meet in the water, fusing to form free-floating or planktonic larvae.  These larvae are called planulae.  To compensate for the hazardous mode of reproduction, coral reproduce incredibly large amounts of planulae.  Within the coral life cycle, the highest mortality rate is in between that of the planulae and the stage of settlement."

Overfishing Whereas most undersea ecosystems foster plant growth, coral dominates certain regions because optimal conditions inhibit algae.  The alga is a non flowering plant, like seaweed, that conducts photosynthesis.  While such organisms are beneficial to plant life, they can restrict needed oxygen for coral and repress beneficial bacteria.  According to researchers, this can reduce coral generation up to 37 percent.  Much of this reduction relates to overfishing.  This practice eliminates fish and other species that feed on algae, keeping the plants’ presence at a non-threatening level.  Fortunately, technology exists to extract algae near the reefs with machines.  Nevertheless, long-term health is preserved only through dialing back the fishing.  Epidemic Among Diadema Antillarum One of the primary species that feast on algae is the diadema antillarum, or the black sea urchin.  Over 30 years ago, however, the urchins started to die off, especially in the Caribbean reefs and elsewhere in the south Atlantic.  The disease is still mysterious to marine epidemiologists but its symptoms are consistent: loss of pigment, build-up of sediment, spinal deterioration and loss of substrates (the spindle projections common among urchins).

Check the basic parameters before you investigate other possible reasons.  The first thing that comes to my mind is to check the salinity.  If that’s on point, check the levels of calcium in the water.  All LPS corals, including the Torch Coral, need calcium in order to make their skeleton.  These corals can be affected by intense lighting, as well.  Avoid placing them under metal halides.  And always acclimate them slowly when you move them in a new tank.  And last, Torch Corals are susceptible to diseases and infections like any other organism.  The most common ones are the brown jelly and protozoan infections.  How to Propagate the Torch Coral The Torch Coral is a great candidate for propagation.  And it’s not that difficult to propagate it just by yourself, as well.  Especially with branching types of corals, like the Torch Coral itself.  First, make sure that that specimen you will use is in good health condition.

As a result, when this happens the flow also needs to be adequate to move their waste products away.  It is also my opinion that in many tanks flow is still an underappreciated and under emphasized aspect of a successful tank.  So if corals die again for seemingly no reason, then flow around the dead coral and in the entire tank should be examined and usually increased.  When corals get this large they can not only shade themselves but also any corals underneath them as well One additional caveat that should also be addressed in terms of a coral’s needs changing as well the stress that occurs when a coral is moved and that is corals may die if they are constantly moved around in a tank."

They also protect shorelines from storm surges and support the livelihoods of many people through fishing and tourism related activities.  Current models predict that most reefs will experience mass bleaching events by midcentury.  However, these models do not account for the ability of corals to adapt to heat stress.  Adaption may occur, for example, if heat tolerant zooxanthellae were to evolve inside of the coral tissue or if corals started to produce heat shock proteins that improved their tolerance to heat stress.  Cheryl Logan, an assistant professor at California State University, and her colleagues used models to explore the future state of coral reefs under different climate change scenarios when adaptation responses were either included or excluded from the analyses.  They found that the impacts of climate change on coral reefs were predicted to be less severe at the end of the 21st century if adaptive responses were included in models.

Some scientists believe that human actions are increasing greenhouse gases (gases like carbon dioxide that let in almost all the sun's radiation, but block much of the outgoing radiation from Earth).  They call this global warming.  They believe the Earth's atmosphere is getting warmer.  If true this could upset the delicate balance of temperatures that coral reefs need to thrive.  Coral reefs are important in determining the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  The zooxanthellae algae, through photosynthesis, remove carbon dioxide from the air and make carbohydrates available as food for both the zooxanthellae and the coral polyps.  Eventually, much of the carbon removed from the air will reside on the ocean bottom in the form of limestone produced by coral polyps.  However, both the coral polyps and the zooxanthellae must also use oxygen through the process of respiration (the same process humans use in breathing).  Respiration releases carbon dioxide into the ocean and atmosphere."

The parasite benefits by gaining nutrients, but does so at the expense of the host because it now needs to eat more in order to survive.  Zooxanthellae are photosynthetic algae that live inside coral polyps.  Coral polyps and zooxanthellae have a mutalistic symbiotic relationship.  The calcium carbonate skeleton produced by the coral polyps provides the zooxanthellae with a protected environment suitable for photosynthesis.  In return, the photosynthetic algae produce oxygen and aid the coral in removing waste.  Additionally, zooxanthellae provide the coral with nutrients such as glucose, glyserol, and amino acids, which are products of photosynthesis.  These compounds are utilized by the coral as building blocks in the manufacture of fats, as well as the synthesis of their calcium carbonate skeleton.  Some polyps are able to capture enough nutrients to survive without zooxanthellae, but these are rare.  It has been found that zooxanthellae donate up to ninety percent of the organic material produced during photosynthesis to the host coral tissue.  When coral polyps become stressed due to a change in the environment, often caused by human activity, they can lose the zooxanthellae."

Coral also lives alongside algae, but if there are too many algae then they compete with corals for space.  This happens because climate change has given the algae an advantage over coral reefs.  It turns out that algae were not the only problem, as they also caused a change in the coral’s microbiome.  The high amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released by the algae allowed for an explosion of microbes and depleted all of the oxygen in the area.  The corals became unable to get any oxygen because their own microbes ate it up.  It was not a new pathogen that posed problems; instead, it was just an overgrowth of existing bacteria within these corals.  It is clear from this study that human activity has impacted how corals interact with their microbiomes.  Microbes play an important role in our health.  In fact, they help determine whether we are healthy or not.  They’re meant to live in harmony with each other.  When that harmony is disturbed, the microbes can change and cause disease.  This idea has been studied since the 1990s by scientists who study germ-free mice (mice without any bacteria)."

Conservation By: Eva Gruber With the recent tragic news of the Great Barrier Reef experiencing the largest mass coral bleaching event ever, we can no longer ignore the fact that coral reefs the world over are in sheer danger.  Coral reef ecosystems take centuries to grow and develop, and it is no small matter to be losing them due to anthropogenic activities in a matter of years.  At least 19% of the world’s coral reefs – including 50% of those in the Caribbean – are already gone, and within 20 years, if current trends continue, we could lose another 15%, according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.  Image Credit: http://all-that-is-interesting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/coral-reef-bleaching-after.jpg If climate change continues unabated, all the coral reefs on the planet could be gone within one human generation.  That means all the global coral reef system – with all of its biodiversity and fisheries supporting millions of poor people around the world – will be wiped out.

34305,145_2-1,0,MARCO_14_336789855-6,0,"As ocean resources become scarce, the seafood industry will flounder. Some models show that shellfish populations alone could plunge so much that it will lead to losses of $480 million by the end of the century.  This will mean less money and fewer jobs.  It will also mean less food for consumers.  Currently, there are 200 million jobs worldwide related to fishing.  These jobs will largely vanish.  It is not just the seafood industry.  The tourism industry is also likely to be sacrificed with unchecked ocean pollution.  Coral reefs are popular with tourists who put money into local economies through snorkeling and scuba diving.  Beach communities are protected by reefs, which limit erosion and rising water levels.  As these ecological features die off, coastal areas will be swamped and valuable land will be lost.  The effects will be wider reaching still.  The ocean thrives with carbon.  When these ecosystems are lost or diminished, more carbon is released into the air.  This only accelerates humanity’s problem with climate change and global warming.  As these problems worsen, the geopolitical response will grow more tense.  Ocean resources will likely become a point of contention, leading to international haggling and conflict.  With scarce seafood supplies, tensions will flare, and humanity will be forced to reckon with its limited capacity."
34300,145_2-1,0,MARCO_14_1269887941-9,0,"When bleaching occurs, the reefs lose much of their characteristic color as the algae and the coral animals die if loss of the symbiotic zooxanthellae is prolonged. Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide further threaten the corals in other ways; as CO 2 dissolves in ocean waters, it lowers the pH and increases ocean acidity.  As acidity increases, it interferes with the calcification that normally occurs as coral animals build their calcium carbonate homes.  When a coral reef begins to die, species diversity plummets as animals lose food and shelter.  Coral reefs are also economically important tourist destinations, so the decline of coral reefs poses a serious threat to coastal economies.  Human population growth has damaged corals in other ways, too.  As human coastal populations increase, the runoff of sediment and agricultural chemicals has increased, too, causing some of the once-clear tropical waters to become cloudy.  At the same time, overfishing of popular fish species has allowed the predator species that eat corals to go unchecked.  Although a rise in global temperatures of 1–2˚C (a conservative scientific projection) in the coming decades may not seem large, it is very significant to this biome.  When change occurs rapidly, species can become extinct before evolution leads to new adaptations."

A decrease in coral cover can also reduce habitat for fish, with implications for reef-based fisheries.  Photo © Stacey Kilarski, Thailand Coral bleaching and associated mortality not only have negative impacts on coral communities, but they also impact fish communities and the human communities that depend on coral reefs and associated fisheries for livelihoods and wellbeing.  Ecological impacts of coral bleaching and related mortality: Bleached corals are likely to have reduced growth rates, decreased reproductive capacity, increased susceptibility to diseases and elevated mortality rates.  Changes in coral community composition can occur when more susceptible species are killed by bleaching events.  Changes in coral communities also affect the species that depend on them, such as the fish and invertebrates that rely on live coral for food, shelter, or recruitment habitat.  Change in the abundance and composition of reef fish assemblages may occur when corals die as a result of coral bleaching.  Declines in genetic and species diversity may occur when corals die as a result of bleaching.  Healthy coral reefs attract divers and other tourists.  Bleached and degraded reefs can discourage tourism, which can affect the local economy."

When El Nino occurred in 1997-1998, widespread and severe coral reef bleaching occurred in the Indo-Pacific region and the Caribbean, killing 16% of the world’s coral reefs in 12 months.  Photo credit: World Resources Institute The 2010 El Nino has also resulted in massive bleaching around the world.  Scientists don’t yet understand the long-term impacts of coral bleaching, but they do know that bleaching leaves corals vulnerable to disease, stunts their growth, and affects their reproduction, while severe bleaching kills them.  The 30 million tons of carbon dioxide our oceans absorb every day is changing the chemistry of seawater and increasing acidification.  Today, coral reefs are experiencing warmer ocean temperatures and more acidity than they have at any time in the last 400,000 years.  Acidification reduces the water’s carrying capacity for calcium carbonate that corals need to build their skeletons.  Even a small decrease in the coral’s ability to construct its skeleton can leave it vulnerable to erosion, and research suggests that coral reefs will begin to dissolve if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels double this century."
34419,145_2-3,0,MARCO_08_339605649-7,0,"A promising twist is that the more heat-tolerant species seem also to be more transplant-friendly. After experimentally planting some 400 samples from the two reef areas back into the two pools, Palumbi and his team found that the corals from the hotter pools transplanted more efficiently and grew faster than those from the cooler pools.  This August, Palumbi and his colleagues plan to begin an experimental restoration project on Sili Reef off Ofu Island.  To select the best corals, the researchers will rely on their extensive data for the area, including growth measurements and transcriptomes — blueprints of the part of the genome that is actively transcribed into proteins.  They also plan to use data from a portable stress test for corals that Palumbi is developing — “like a human treadmill test for cardiac function”, he says.  He and his team have built tanks out of 7.5-litre cooler boxes rigged with lights, heaters and chillers that can dose corals with a controlled bout of high physiological stress.  By monitoring bleaching and chlorophyll content, they should be able to predict how corals might respond to potential bleaching conditions.  Using all this information as a guide, they will handpick the hardiest, fastest-growing and most heat-resistant corals for their smart reef."
34413,145_2-3,0,MARCO_05_294927663-1,0,"Ocean Acidification Definition Ocean Acidification Definition by Laurent Cousineau (Montreal)  Ocean acidification refers to the increase in acidity of seawater due to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide.  Essentially, not all of the carbon dioxide that mankind emits remains in the atmosphere.  In fact, a fairly large portion enters the ocean, and this reduces its pH, which increases its acidity as a result.  Will Cause Coral Bleaching Consequently, ocean acidification may cause a reduction in the calcification rates of calcifying organisms.  These include corals, mollusks, algae and crustaceans.  By reducing the calcification rates of corals, ocean acidification will, in turn, cause coral bleaching.  Ocean Acidification and Climate Change Although climate change and ocean acidification are two very different environmental issues, they share the same cause: carbon dioxide emissions.  In essence, by reducing our emissions of carbon dioxide, we will not only mitigate climate change, but we will also help stop ocean acidification.  Although ocean acidification may sound like a trivial issue, it is not.  Importance of Coral Reefs Millions of marine species depend on coral colonies, and many of these species lie at the bottom of the oceans' food chain.  When coral reefs are bleached, all marine species are affected since they all depend on one another."
34402,145_2-3,0,KILT_51017707-4,0,"Additionally, if atmospheric carbon dioxide reaches 800 ppm, the ocean surface water pH decrease will be 0.4 units and total dissolved carbonate ion concentration will have decreased by at least 60%. At this point it is almost certain that all reefs of the world will be in erosional states.  Increasing the pH and replicating pre-industrialization ocean chemistry conditions in the Great Barrier Reef, however, led to an increase in coral growth rates by 7%.   Section::::Coral health.:Temperature.   Ocean acidification can also lead to increased sea surface temperature.  An increase of about 1 or 2 °C can cause the collapse of the relationship between coral and zooxanthellae, possibly leading to bleaching.  Average sea surface temperature in the Great Barrier Reef is predicted to increase between 1 and 3 °C by 2100.  This breakdown of the relationship between the coral and the zooxanthellae occurs when Photosystem II is damaged, either due to a reaction with the D1 protein or a lack of carbon dioxide fixation; these result in a lack of photosynthesis and can lead to bleaching.   Section::::Coral health.:Reproduction.   Ocean acidification threatens coral reproduction throughout almost all aspects of the process.Gametogenesis may be indirectly affected by coral bleaching.  Additionally, the stress that acidification puts on coral can potentially harm the viability of the sperm released."

At least1/2 of the oxygen we breathe comes from the photosynthesis of marine plants.  Currently, 48% of the carbon emitted to the atmosphere by fossil fuel burning issequestered into the ocean.  But the future fate of this important carbon sink isquite uncertain because of potential climate change impacts on oceancirculation, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystem dynamics.  Carbon atoms areconstantly being cycled through the earth's ocean by a number of physical andbiological processes.  The flux of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and theocean is a function of surface mixing (related to wind speed) and the differencethe concentration of carbon dioxide in the air and water The concentration inthe ocean depends on the atmosphere and ocean carbon dioxide partial pressurewhich, in turn, is a function of temperature, alkalinity (which is closelyrelated to salinity), photosynthesis, and respiration.

Under such conditions the zooxanthellae may lose substantial amounts of their photosynthetic pigmentation, which decreases rates of photosynthesis and produces bleaching.  In addition, studies have found that the chemicals in sunscreens and other personal care products can accumulate in areas with significant marine tourism and recreational use by humans and can promote viral infections in hard corals that lead to bleaching.  Exposure to increased temperatures and solar irradiance also causes zooxanthellae to manufacture abnormally large quantities of reactive oxygen species (molecules that contain oxygen and at least one unpaired electron ), which are toxic to both the algae and their coral symbionts.  These changes ultimately cause a breakdown of the symbiotic relationship, characterized by the physical separation of the zooxanthellae from their coral hosts.  If zooxanthellae do not recolonize the coral within a few months of leaving, their absence can result in the death of individual corals as well as the coral colony to which they belong."

This increases the Earth’s temperature, and this is known as Global warming.  In a nutshell, when the carbon dioxide increases, the global temperature increases, which leads to the rise in global warming and increasing global warming causes the greenhouse effect.  HOW DOES CARBON DIOXIDE CAUSE AIR POLLUTION?  In atmosphere carbon dioxide is occurred naturally.  During photosynthesis, it plays an essential part.  Since the Industrial Revolution, the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased.  Deforestation and burning of fossil fuels such as coal are the primary causes for this.  As the level of carbon dioxide is increased, it affects air pollution.  Less than 1 percent of the atmospheric gases, carbon dioxide is gauged.  However, between carbon dioxide and other gases, a delicate balance exists.  Carbon dioxide also plays its role in greenhouse gas, thus contributing to air pollution.  Now a question that arises here is how to overcome this problem of Air Pollution?  Planting those indoor and outdoor plants which absorbs carbon dioxide from air can be a solution to this cause.  This is an initiative you can take sitting in your homes and contribute to minimizing the air pollution.  BENEFITS:  The Oxygen levels can be increased by adding houseplants to your home."

NASA has observed increases in the amount of carbon dioxide and some other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.  Too much of these greenhouse gases can cause Earth's atmosphere to trap more and more heat.  This causes Earth to warm up.  What reduces the greenhouse effect on Earth?  Just like a glass greenhouse, Earth's greenhouse is also full of plants!  Plants can help to balance the greenhouse effect on Earth.  All plants — from giant trees to tiny phytoplankton in the ocean — take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen.  The ocean also absorbs a lot of excess carbon dioxide in the air.  Unfortunately, the increased carbon dioxide in the ocean changes the water, making it more acidic.  This is called ocean acidification.  More acidic water can be harmful to many ocean creatures, such as certain shellfish and coral.  Warming oceans — from too many greenhouse gases in the atmosphere — can also be harmful to these organisms.  Warmer waters are a main cause of coral bleaching.

(The extra airline fees are just the beginning of the trouble with extra or heavy bags—train stations and hotels don’t always have elevators!)  It’s tough but doable, especially if you plan ahead.  If you’re not sure if your suitcase is too heavy, carry it a couple of blocks at a fast clip, or up a flight of stairs without stopping.  If you’re uncomfortable, it’s too heavy.  (We recommend this activity for pre-dawn, before the neighbors wake up and wonder if you’ve finally gone over the edge.)  On most bicycle tours, you’re on the move with little time for laundry and drying.  When possible, travel with fast-drying clothing – from undergarments to outerwear.  Check out our clothing recommendations.  Synthetic fabrics/blends are not only the most breathable and quick drying, they can also be the easiest to pack (the worst fabric to ride in is cotton)."

34904,146_1-3,0,MARCO_48_1491483192-5,0,"We also liked the zippered outside pockets and mesh side panels for even more organization-centric storage. Two Wheel Gear says this bag is made of 600-denier TPE-coated polyester (so water will roll off of it), but it comes with a rain cover for true downpours.  The company offers a two-year limited warranty against defects in craftsmanship.  Flaws but not dealbreakers: The rain flaps that cover the zippers are very stiff, almost to a point of frustration.  We were often left wrestling with zippers caught at weird angles.  That said, we don’t think that’s a good enough reason not to buy this bag if you like everything else about it.  This bag may not be large enough if you want to carry along a lot of extras such as lunch and a change of clothes.  Two Wheel Gear does make a bigger bag, the Pannier Backpack Convertible Plus+, which is 30 L and would be the right size if that’s your goal.  However, we haven’t tested it yet."
35208,146_1-5,0,MARCO_54_225095098-14,0,No doubt this addition to your bikepacking kit will put a smile on your face when you’re 100kms into a ride and all you want is snacks at your fingertips! View at REI THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN BUYING BIKEPACKING BAGS STYLE There are seven main styles of bikepacking bags listed above: Trunk Bag These sit on top of a rear rack and are one of the larger bags used when bikepacking.  Pannier These are used in a pair for even weight distribution and are typically attached to a rear or front rack.  Panniers will often boast the largest carrying capacity of all the bags available for bikepacking.  Seat-Pack or Saddle-Bag These attach to your seat and seat post and come in a variety of sizes.  They are often used for lightweight touring and bikepacking.  Frame Bag These sit in the middle triangle of your bike frame and will either take up the entire area (full frame bag) or part of the area (half frame bag).  Frame bags are great for storing heavier items as they help keep the center of gravity low when riding.  Top Tube Bag These are small bags that sit on the top tube of your bike.  Top tube bags are commonly used for storing valuables and ride nutrition and they provide easy access while riding.
35070,146_1-5,0,MARCO_19_1932497705-3,0,"These are two examples of common pannier setups: Front and rear panniers – photo credit Rear panniers only, riding into Ushuaia Argentina What are bikepacking bags? Bikepacking bags attach directly to your bike without a rack.  Because there are so many different types and sizes of bikes, bikepacking bags have a lot more variation.  A typical bikepacking bag setup would include some or all of these parts: Handlebar bag (often a roll-style bag) Saddle / seat bag Frame bag Top tube bag for small items Feed bags for snacks and small items Bikepackers sometimes also attach mounts to the front fork for bottles or other small cargo.  This is an example of a bikepacking bag setup: Bikepacking in New Mexico Bikepacking bags are usually (but not always) associated with the “bikepacking” style, loosely defined as: shorter and/or more focused trips within a particular backcountry area, lighter and/or more minimal gear, more dirt trails than roads, more remote than populated, more camping than hotels.  Panniers: Pros and Cons To understand why different types of bike bags are used for different types of trips, it helps to understand what each type of system is best at.  Here are the biggest pros and cons of a rack and pannier setup."
35054,146_1-5,0,MARCO_15_1879999540-23,0,"The Kona Libre AL is a true gravel e-bike in every sense of the word, from the dropper seatpost to the 650 x 47 tyres and the Shimano GRX gearing, Kona have used their mountain bike heritage to good effect to provide a truly versatile machine. The MTB-specific Shimano Steps E7000 motor is really responsive to pedalling input and only really needs to be used in full power on the steepest of climbs.  I’m really impressed with the new Merida eSilex +600 – it’s ready for a spot of bike packing, all you need to do is add bags.  The fact that it’s so light and has all those mounting points make it viable for touring / bike packing.  The battery range will depend on how much you rely on the e-assist – I would recommend riding it like a regular bike and use the electric to help you with steep climbs.  Another absolute corker of a bike is the BMC Alpenchallenge AMP Sport Three DB – with a fully carbon frame and Micro Travel system in the rear, it really does take the sting out of rough terrain.

All their stock will be sent in BIG cardboard boxes and they usually have some of these in stock.  Get one that's big enough and one that has handles if possible.  They should be able to give you some plastic axles too.  Get hold of some material that you insulate pipes with.  This comes in various thickness and you may be lucky with off cuts from a DIY store, alternatively use the mountains of bubble wrap you have after buying stuff from Scan!  Select first on the bike (big cog at the back) - this makes the rear mech not stick out.  If you can take the pedals off then this really helps.  Put the pipes around all of the main tubes and the rear seat stays.  Next, take off the front wheel and the seat post/seat.  Put plastic axle where front wheel went and put some more piping on the fork legs.  To put it into the box turn the handlebars through 90°.  You may have to let the tyres down to get it in.  It should fit snugly.  Next put the front wheel in."

You can find titanium touring bikes too, which are notably expensive, but they’re tough and light, and the vibration damping can be a godsend on rough roads and dirt.  Touring Bike Geometry There are a handful of subtle differences within touring bike geometries that set them apart from road bikes.  Touring geometry is more upright, creating a riding position that’s more comfortable during long hours in the saddle.  You’ll see different bike companies refer to this as their “endurance” or “adventure” geometry.  This “endurance” geometry plays out in a handful of different ways.  The wheelbase and chainstay of a classic touring bike is typically longer to make room for rear racks and panniers, and the bottom bracket is typically lower to increase stability.  The head tube is typically longer on a touring bike, essentially elevating the handlebar, and there’s more slack, helping to extend the wheelbase.  Touring bikes also generally have a shorter top tube, or more important, a shorter “reach,” which is the distance from the center of the bottom bracket to the top of the head tube."

If this isn’t enough for you, consider checking out adjustable levers – a very common modification on sport bikes – that can extend or retract the lever to where it’s most comfortable for you.  Adjusting Your Clip-on Handlebars Some sport bikes allow you to rotate the clip-on bars to be closer in or wider out.  Just as with the levers, simply loosen the pinch bolts and rotate them in or out while sitting on the bike to a position that is more comfortable for you, then tighten them back up.  Tip: there are typically two pinch bolts holding clip-ons onto the fork leg – when tightening them, make sure to do them evenly, alternating with half-turns on each until they are both tight.  Check torque specs and use a torque wrench if you can – pinch bolts are usually not torqued very hard.  Adjusting Your Shifter Peg /Brake Everyone’s foot size is different, so where the shifter and brake pegs fall on your bike may not be where it’s most comfortable for you.  Luckily, this is a very easy-to-do adjustment on virtually any bike."

Cruisers If you’re looking for a comfortable bike with a classic look, consider a cruiser.  The bicycle standard from the 1930s through 1950s, cruisers feature wide tires and padded seats for a more comfortable riding experience.  Curved, upright handlebars put the rider in a better position to view the world around them.  Cruisers typically have heavier frames, but some newer models use lightweight aluminum frames.  The traditional cruiser has just one gear, but more modern cruisers come with three to seven speeds.  Also called beach bikes or boulevardiers, these classic bikes work best on flat terrain.  Utility/Cargo Bikes Perfect for hauling groceries, camping gear, and other items—utility and cargo bikes feature a sturdy, elongated frame with heavy-duty storage racks over the rear tires.  A variety of accessories can be hooked onto the rear rack, such as baskets, child seats, and panniers to hold your gear.  The upright seating position gives you a good view of the road, the rims have extra spokes for additional strength, and the wider tires offer a more stable ride.

A motorcycle tank bag is a must have for any long distance ride.  With the ability to safely store everything from your keys, phone, lip balm, point and shoot camera, sunglasses, water, and spare change, a tank bag can come in really handy.  Most tank bags are secured to the top of the tank with either a strap/quick release buckle system or heavy-duty magnets.  The Cortech Super 2.0 18 Liter Magnetic Mount Tank Bag is pretty slick because nothing is left on the bike when you take it off.

35591,146_1-9,0,MARCO_16_2700237145-19,0,"Drop handlebars 'drop' as they curve forward and down, offering the cyclist best braking power from a more aerodynamic 'crouched' position, as well as more upright positions in which the hands grip the brake lever mounts, the forward curves, or the upper flat sections for increasingly upright postures. Mountain bikes generally feature a 'straight handlebar' or 'riser bar' with varying degrees of sweep backwards and centimeters rise upwards, as well as wider widths which can provide better handling due to increased leverage against the wheel.  Seating A Selle San Marco saddle designed for women Saddles also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more room for leg swings.  Comfort depends on riding position.  With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable.  For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient.  Differing saddle designs exist for male and female cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men."

Their ability to make a huge hit with an obscure title like Guardians of the Galaxy is incredible, so I'd say Marvel right now has a feature film advantage.  DC has a shallower bench with fewer big properties, but their holy trinity of superman, batman and wonder woman is unequalled.  We will see how well they execute.  Marvel has a great many more valuable franchises currently but Marvel lacks the unified structure of DC so it's harder for them to explore their universe cinematically, with franchises divided over several studios, but even DC had to separate Arrow and Flash from Supergirl.  We will see whether DC can develop more successful characters with their upcoming, ambitious plans.  In print, they are both pretty feeble, both in terms of sales and in terms of imagination.  Stan Lee used to be a unifying force at Marvel, slightly more engaged that DCs Julius Schwartz, but it feels like both companies are drifting in their print divisions with DC's unsuccessful 52 reboot and Marvel about to do the same with Secret Wars.

This is certainly open to debate and remains unaddressed in the MCU at present, but the Ancient One does seem to imply that any sort of meddling with the timeline can create splits in the natural flow and use of the Time Stone certainly falls into this category.  Problematically, it clearly wasn't the intention of the Russo brothers ' or of writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely to imply that Scarlet Witch beat Thanos in a different timeline and several inconsistencies emerge as a result.  If using the Time Stone to rewrite Vision's death created a separate timeline, would that new plane of reality have its own set of Infinity Stones?  This was certainly the case when the Avengers traveled back through the Quantum Realm.  Additionally, if Thanos jumped from the reality with a destroyed Mind Stone to another, would that world not have its own version of Thanos?

Avengers: Endgame is the climax of the MCU to date, an event movie that's frankly unparalleled in the history of cinema.  While Thanos is sure to be defeated, there will be massive consequences for Marvel's entire shared universe, and Spider-Man: Far From Home is set to explore these.

Fans generally assume that each MCU phase will end with an Avengers film, but that's not necessarily the case.

Emmett Brown is in an undisclosed location outside Hill Valley, California.  He sets a video camera to track his body in order to videotape a message for Marty McFly.  He explains that it is October 21, 2015, one hour before Marty, Doc, and Jennifer Parker arrive from 1985.  He explains that when he traveled to the future, he discovered that there was a nuclear holocaust that occurred on October 21, 2045.  He tracked it down to four inventions: the food hydrator, self-lacing shoes, the hoverboard, and the Mr. Fusion home energy reactor.  The former three inventions led to the world becoming lazy and obese, leading to widespread waste.  The invention of hoverboards led to hovercars, which led to people throwing their trash out of the windows, causing a great trash storm in 2021.  All of this trash needed to be disposed of, which led to 100 million Mr. Fusion units being manufactured.  All of the Mr. Fusion units had a tiny nuclear reactor inside, and all of them detonated on October 21, 2045."

This uncertainty, the feeling that anything could happen, helps make a world otherwise made up of borrowed elements feel novel, absorbing.  Conversely, Star Wars shows how an unfamiliar world can make a predictable plot feel wondrous.  The first three films indulged in mythic-formula storytelling but placed it in a magical junkyard future that seemed surprising, different, bizarre.  Now, The Force Awakens has ignited a debate about whether it’s okay for Star Wars to forgo further world-building.  If it is okay, it’s only because of how sturdy and inimitable George Lucas’s original universe was.  For a lot of people, the trappings of the 1977 Star Wars remains fresh enough to thrill; though the franchise has reshaped pop culture, lightsabers and TIE Fighters haven’t quite been as pervasively knocked off as Tolkien’s elvish cities and enchanted swords have been.  As for the storytelling: The Force Awakens apes A New Hope apes Joseph Campbell, but the the archetypal heroes themselves represent a small innovation."

Avengers: Endgame features a considerable amount of time travel, and one character's age in particular becomes especially hard to track.  By Hannah Shaw-Williams Published May 05, 2019 Share Share Tweet Email 0 Comment Captain America gets a happy ending in Avengers: Endgame, going back in time to finally get that dance with Peggy Carter before living out the rest of his life with her - but exactly how old is he by the end of the movie?  Between being frozen in the Arctic ice for 66 years, his modern adventures with the Avengers, Endgame 's five-year time jump and Steve's final trip back to the past, it can be hard to keep track.  In terms of his physical age, Steve hands over his shield to Sam Wilson when he's a spry 114 years old, or thereabouts.  However, he's actually been alive for about 180 years.  Though he's certainly got a few wrinkles when he meets up with Sam and Bucky again in 2023, he doesn't appear to be on the verge of death and clearly ages slower than a regular human being thanks to the super soldier serum."

As Marvel fans already know, the comic book incarnation of Shuri dedicated her life to becoming the first female Black Panther ever since childhood.  At first, T’Challa beat her to it, but Shuri continued to protect Wakanda against the likes of Ulysses Klaw and Radioactive Man, proving that she was worthy of the mantle.  Soon after, T’Challa vowed to train his sister how to fight, and ended up replacing the King of Wakanda as Black Panther after he fell into a dangerous coma, even though the Panther god, Bast, initially rejected her.  While Ryan Coogler’s movie adaptation does stray from the source material at times, subtle hints threaded throughout Black Panther suggest that actress, Letitia Wright, may still claw her way to center stage in the MCU one day, mirroring Shuri’s path in the comics.  The most notable example of this occurs early on in the film when Zuri (Forest Whitaker) asks if anyone is willing to challenge T'Challa for the power of Black Panther."

They help cultivate compassion, awareness, and understanding.  Many of us find our best friends in books.  They are a safe place to learn, love, and explore.

As a white person in a predominantly white country, I also began to gain a better understanding of and a greater appreciation for the black experience in the United States.  Is the Bible a book by a white God for white people?  Of course not.  God is spirit and does not have “color” in our human and earthly sense.  There is nothing in the Scriptures to indicate that people are excluded from God’s saving grace on the basis of ethnic origin or skin color.  God is “not wanting anyone to perish” (2 Peter 3:9).  Jesus is the Savior of all peoples.  Nevertheless, it is a fact that the majority of European artists and Bible commentators painted and described all biblical characters, including God, as white.  This had the effect of excluding blacks from being a part of Scripture and has led some people of color to question the Bible’s relevance to them.  Exclusion was only one side of the problem.

Sixty percent of the company's employees are white; that jumps to 72 percent when looking at leadership roles.  Overall, fewer than 2 percent of Twitter's employees are black, and none are in leadership roles.  While it's true that many major tech companies have similar diversity statistics, but Twitter's numbers stand out because so many of its users are black.   And the disparity between the company and its users has not gone unnoticed.  To address some of those issues, Twitter announced that it has hired a new vice president for diversity and inclusion, Jeffery Siminoff.  The fifty-year-old replaces Janet Van Huysse, and comes from a similar role at Apple.

Below, you’ll find the 23 MCU canon films ranked from worst to best.  Go forth, and at the end, consider grabbing shawarma.  [ Ed.  note: This post contains spoilers for every Marvel movie, including Spider-Man: Far From Home] Marvel Studios 23.  Iron Man 2 (2010)  The first MCU sequel became notorious for rolling through production without a finished script.  Even after the heavily improvised Iron Man left Jeff Bridges fuming, director Jon Favreau, Robert Downey Jr., and writer Justin Theroux (yes, the star of The Leftovers) mapped out most of Iron Man 2 on the fly.  Unfortunately, whatever happened the first time didn’t happen again: Tony Stark’s second outing is a glue-and-popsicle-sticks creation with inert action and flirtatious relationship with the Demon in a Bottle arc."

Eric Franklin May 3, 2018 4:00 a.m. PT 1 of 19 Universal Studios 19: The Incredible Hulk We're going from worst to best, so we have to start somewhere. '  The Incredible Hulk ' from 2008 (not to be confused with 'Hulk' from 2003) isn't a bad movie.  Yes, you could totally skip it and not miss a story beat in the MCU saga, but that doesn't make it bad.  It just means that the stuff that happens here has little bearing on everything after.  That said, it's certainly not a great movie.  It failed to make the relationship between Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) and Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) worth caring about and was devoid of the humor the MCU is now known for.  The biggest issue, however, is with Bruce himself.  He doesn't want to turn into the Hulk, but at the end of the day, that's all you want him to do."

As a result, African American consumers have shifted to watching online digital content, said Tameez, who worked at the Star-Telegram in Fort Worth as a diversity writer covering social equity issues in 2018 and 2019.  “For communities of color and marginalized people, there is distrust with legacy media or traditional news outlets,” she said.  “They have poorly covered or ignored communities all together or have gotten stories wrong or only go into their communities for crime or violence.”  Tameez said increases in paid viewer subscriptions to shows such as #RolandMartinUnfiltered also can be attributed to relatability: Black viewers relate to reporters who don’t perpetuate racial stereotypes.  Recent research supports her point of view.  According to a recent study, the State of Consumer Engagement, 74 percent of Black viewers watch ethnic media occasionally and 44 percent watch frequently.  The findings, released Aug. 12, were conducted by New York based Horowitz Research.  Adriana Waterston, Horowitz’s senior vice president of Insights and Strategies, said in a news release announcing the results of the study that the country’s social environment contributes to the increasing popularity of multicultural podcasts like #RolandMartinUnfiltered."

Breakbeat patterns may also occur briefly in the background at certain points.   Whilst breakbeat hardcore itself was not popular in Scotland, its synthesiser sounds were found in bouncy techno's range of stab melodies.  N-Joi's 'Live In Manchester' (1992) feast provided further general inspiration.  Its hallmark is the single-keyed offbeat note, which relates to its 'bouncy' designation (this offbeat focus was found in the latter bouncy house namesake).  These rhythmic combinations and arrangements were described by Simon Reynolds as being reminiscent of klezmer music, fairground-like melodies and oom-pah offbeat notes.   The N-Joi group provided another important attribute.  Unlike other rave music from this period, the Scottish scene was performance driven where bands often headlined raves rather than DJs.  Acts were expected to have costumes, dancers and the best stage performance.  Dancers were dressed in baggy tracksuit-like attire and had their own form of dance that involves a lot of rapid leg movements.  The performances of Ultra-Sonic filtered through to the like Scooter on a wider level.   Section::::See also.   BULLET::::- List of electronic music genres"

How much do Cranston and Paul earn per episode as meth cooks?  Cranston takes home a cool $225,000 per episode, while Paul earns $150,000.  (Not bad for someone who was originally supposed to be killed off at the end of season one.)  That puts Cranston's salary for the final eight episodes of the series at $1.8 million.  Paul would take home $1.2 million.  For a comparison, Cranston is making as much as what each of the 'How I Met Your Mother' cast members earns ($225,000) and nearly as much as Damian Lewis on Showtime's 'Homeland' ($250,000).  Paul is earning as much as Peter Dinklage earns for his role on HBO's 'Game of Thrones' per episode and more than that of 'Elementary' star Lucy Liu ($130,000).  In total, season 5 has 16 episodes.  Provided Cranston and Paul's salary information is the same for the first eight episodes, that would put Cranston at $3.6 million for the entire final season of 'Breaking Bad' while his co-star Paul would make a total of $2.4 million.

'Amidst the Raindrops' A clip of downtempo progressive breaks music.  Problems playing this file?  See media help.  Incorporating many components of those genres, the Florida breaks subgenre followed during the early-to-mid 1990s and had a unique sound that was soon internationally popular among producers, DJs, and club-goers.  In 1994, the influential techno act Autechre released the Anti EP in response to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, deliberately using advanced algorithmic programming to generate non-repetitive breakbeats for the full duration of the tracks, in order to subvert the legal definitions within that legislation which specified in the section creating police powers to remove ravers from raves that ''music' includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats'.  In the late 1990s, another style of breakbeat emerged, funky breaks, a style that was incorporating elements of trance, hip hop and jungle.  It was pioneered by the Chemical Brothers and James Lavelle 's Mo'Wax Records imprint."

So you want a degree in tech, but you’re not sure which route to take.  These days, there are two strong paths to make a career in computers: Computer Science and Information Technology (IT).  Which is right for you?  A Comparison of Degrees To begin, it’s important to understand the distinctions of each.  In Computer Science, you’ll be learning how computers work.  This could be anything from computer languages, software design, or hardware architecture.  It’s just you and the computer having a conversation.  You’ll learn many of the same skills in IT, but your intentions will be different.  You’ll become the mediator between the machine and the end user.  Think of yourself as a translator- you speak both computer and human speech.  It becomes your job to facilitate conversation between two speakers who are often mutually unintelligible.  You’ll be learning skills like computer support, database and systems administration, and network architecture.

This is because jobs at the top are rarer and require a more specialized set of skills.  Typically, you’ll need extensive industry experience – either at Facebook or another tech company – to command a position that is higher up on the Facebook salary band structure.  How Much do Facebook Software Engineers Earn?  Your salary and compensation package as a Facebook software developer will depend on your experience and assigned level.  Those who start at the entry-level will command an E3 salary, while more senior engineers will be assigned higher levels.  As you are promoted, you’ll work your way through these levels.  Facebook compensates its employees fairly, to say the least.  Even jobs at lower positions within the company offer excellent salaries that are comparable to those at companies like Microsoft.

While this accounted for about 12 percent of total employment, the high-tech sector contributed almost 23 percent of output.  According to a study funded by the Workforce Information Council, the high-tech sector can be defined as industries having high concentrations of workers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) occupations.  1  Although the term high-tech has been notoriously difficult to define, as technology changes all the time, this analysis provides an approach to defining jobs that are in in this sector.  This issue of Beyond the Numbers applies the approach used by WIC to Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on industry employment and output."

Author: Natacha Medeiros Updated: Jan 25, 2019 Original: Jan 7, 2014 pinterest-pin-it Last year, I did the scariest thing I've ever done: I graduated from university.  While it's the most amazing feeling to be finished with school (and have a kick-ass degree under my belt), I've had to face the reality of looking for, dare I say it, a career.  That means growing up, but even worse, going to job interviews—OMG.  Before my first one, I obsessed not only about having flushed cheeks, a dry mouth and a racing heart, but also about picking the perfect outfit and equally perfect beauty look.  Needless to say, I was NERVOUS.  The morning of the interview, I swiped on my favourite red lipstick, MAC's Ronnie Red.  As I was ready about an hour too early (I am the queen of punctuality and proud of it!), I had a lot of time to sit and ponder my makeup.  'Are red lips too much?'  I found myself wondering.  I mean, I thought I looked good."

What is the next step in the interviewing process?  Following Up Following up after your interview is extremely important and sets you apart from others being interviewed.  When you are selling something, it is important to have as many touchpoints with the potential clients/customers/buyers as possible, while maintaining the three principles above and not being weird.  It is no different when it comes to selling yourself to a potential employer.  Connect with your interviewer the same day, right after the interview, through LinkedIn.  LinkedIn is a great networking tool!  So, after the interview, sit down for 15 or 30 minutes and craft a great follow-up email.  Need an example?  Dear Sally, Good morning!  I would like to thank you again for the interview yesterday."

You also have procured this task.  The contractor comes and does their part, and you release them by paying the agreed amount of money, and you close the contract.  Afterward, carpentry and painting work starts.  You also have procured these jobs.  Once these contractors complete their tasks, you make payment and then you close these contracts as well.  The building is ready, so you call the client to come and inspect it.  Once the client is satisfied, they accept the building, sign the acceptance letter, and all pending payments are released.  Once you get the payment, you update the lessons learned, and release the team and resources.  Finally, you close the project.  So, it’s evident in this example that the close procurement process is performed many times, but the close project is performed only once—at the end of the project.  Some Key Points Please note the following: The close procurement process must happen before the close project or close phase process.  The close procurement process may occur many times during the project ’s life cycle, but the close project process will be performed only once at the end of the project."

The percent using decentralized search engines is likely even less than that.  However, because they are so new, data for this is actually hard to find.  If decentralized search engines become more popular, there is actually a chance that there may be an increasing fusion between decentralized search engines and cryptocurrencies.  This is because such search engines can make it easier to identify decentralized apps (Dapps) and other programs or companies which use blockchain technology.  For example, one search engine, called Weipoint, was just launched by a former Coinbase engineer named Antonio Juliano.  This search engine makes it easy for searchers to find Dapps that use ethereum-based smart contracts and that run on a blockchain.  This search engine could be the first of many that are based around cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.  Challenges for Decentralized Search Engines For starters, if decentralized search engines get large enough, then it is possible that the main centralized search engine companies could view them as a threat and start to try to compete with them more.

I mean if people from Iran and Egypt can be Caucasians (and even sometimes Afghans), why not Indians.  The more disturbing part: Hell...these Europeans were looking to trade with India.  They spent hell lot of money trying to come to India.  So, at least we were at least equal if not superior to Europeans (white/Caucasian).  How can they naturalize someone coming from Eastern Europe (many came from Slovak countries not knowing English) but not Indians (most Indians coming to U.S. knew quite a lot of English).  But, anyway it shows how people even greatest of governments can be so foolish and dumb and 'racist' at times.  After all, if any one has a right to immigrate to U.S., the first should be Indians (and not Europeans or people from any other country)."

After two years of looking into claims that Google “manipulated its search algorithms to harm vertical websites and unfairly promote its own competing vertical properties,” the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) voted unanimously to end the antitrust portion of its investigation without filing a formal complaint against Google.  The FTC concluded that Google's “practice of favoring its own content in the presentation of search results” did not violate U.S. antitrust laws.  The FTC further determined that even though competitors might be negatively impacted by Google's changing algorithms, Google did not change its algorithms to hurt competitors, but as a product improvement to benefit consumers.   Section::::Arguments.   There are a number of arguments for and against search neutrality.   Section::::Arguments.:Pros.   BULLET::::- Those who advocate search neutrality argue that the results would not be biased towards sites with more advertising, but towards sites most relevant to the user.   BULLET::::- Search neutrality encourages sites to have more quality content rather than pay to rank higher on organic results.   BULLET::::- Restrains search engines from only supporting their best advertisers.   BULLET::::- Search engines would allow traffic to sites that depend on visitors, keeping their results comprehensive, impartial, and based solely on relevance."

The search engine is not biased.  What may be biased is your search history.  Go incognito, refuse cookies, log out of your account (s).  The display you get on your browser isn't the same thing as the search results from the engine.  It is tailored for your consumption based on your useage.  In other words, you create the bias, the website doesn't."
40493,149_2-5,0,MARCO_14_257204425-5,0,"Advantages of Search Neutrality Search results would be more relevant to users and not biased towards sites with more ads Neutral search results emphasize higher quality content over paid ranking Allows for manipulation of search results by an objective algorithm, rather than allowing ranking on an individual basis. Search neutrality minimizes the effects of cultural or ideological “ filter bubbles “.  Disadvantages of Search Neutrality Search bias allows “personalized” search results, people want this bias because it delivers smarter, more predictive results.  Search neutrality minimizes this bias and “personalization”.  Regulating search engines and their results could limit a search engine’s ability to adjust rankings based on their own metrics.  Search Engines Without Tracking Minimize Search Bias Search bias is introduced in two ways.  One is from the search engine’s algorithm side, if it determines that a website is generally clicked on more than others.  The other way happens when a search engine monitors a person’s internet behavior and tailors the results based on their past searches and resulting clicks.  Private search engines that don’t track your searches can’t customize your search results.  If you are seeking unbiased information, this is a good thing.  The convenience of personalized results is countered by the “ filter bubble ” effect this creates."
40491,149_2-5,0,MARCO_14_257204425-2,0,"Search algorithms do not use objective criteria in generating their lists of results for search queries. Search engines may have completely positive intentions, but if their algorithms fail to give people objective and neutral results, they are failing.  93 percent of online experiences begin with a search engine.  If the majority of people’s browsing is determined by a search engine, the search engines have a big responsibility to deliver a complete and accurate representation of information.  Search Encrypt strives to remain a neutral and unbiased source of information on the internet.  Big Search Engines Penalized For Search Bias Back in February 2018, India’s competition commission fined one of the major search engines approximately $21.1 million for abusing its power in the search market.  The European Commission also imposed a record 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) fine on the company for favoring its shopping service and demoting rival offerings.  Adam and Shivaun Raff, the British couple behind the price comparison website Foundem, played a vital role in bringing the search bias issues to light.  If a search engine manipulates its search results to favor its most profitable websites, there isn’t much other websites can do to change the very opaque system by which big search engines do this."

[  What we can learn from these less-than-legit Google Knowledge Graph results] Google cautions that some other things could be going on here, too.  The advertiser in question could have specified that the ad only been shown to certain users for a whole host of reasons, or the advertiser could have specified that the ad only show on certain third-party sites.  “Advertisers can choose to target the audience they want to reach, and we have policies that guide the type of interest-based ads that are allowed,” reads a statement from Google.  The interesting thing about the fake users in the Ad Fisher study, however, is that they had entirely fresh search histories: In fact, the accounts used were more or less identical, except for their listed gender identity."

40752,149_2-7,0,MARCO_16_1883837804-6,0,"Some algorithms collect their own data based on human-selected criteria, which can also reflect the bias of human designers. Other algorithms may reinforce stereotypes and preferences as they process and display 'relevant' data for human users, for example, by selecting information based on previous choices of a similar user or group of users.  Beyond assembling and processing data, bias can emerge as a result of design.  For example, algorithms that determine the allocation of resources or scrutiny (such as determining school placements) may inadvertently discriminate against a category when determining risk based on similar users (as in credit scores).  Meanwhile, recommendation engines that work by associating users with similar users, or that make use of inferred marketing traits, might rely on inaccurate associations that reflect broad ethnic, gender, socio-economic, or racial stereotypes.  Another example comes from determining criteria for what is included and excluded from results.  This criteria could present unanticipated outcomes for search results, such as with flight-recommendation software that omits flights that do not follow the sponsoring airline's flight paths.  Algorithms may also display an uncertainty bias, offering more confident assessments when larger data sets are available.  This can skew algorithmic processes toward results that more closely correspond with larger samples, which may disregard data from underrepresented populations."

To do this, Google’s search algorithms rely on hundreds of unique cues or factors .  These factors make it possible to almost guess what you are really looking for on the Internet to offer you a list of possible answers, ordered from highest to lowest according to their relevance to that particular search.  So can I find out how a search algorithm like Google works?  Although, for obvious reasons, we cannot completely decipher it, we can know some basic aspects and, thanks to them, deduce the minimum requirements that this algorithm has been taking into account.  And of course we can get information about how it works to optimize our SEO strategy .  However, it is not always easy to obtain such information.  That is why, I will tell you about the particularities of Internet search algorithms and the histories of three of the main search engines today.  How Do The 3 Most Popular Search Algorithms On The Internet Work?  I want to share with you today a topic that more and more people are interested in on the internet: how a search algorithm works and which one is treading stronger today."

The ranking system is based on an algorithm though this algorithm is not secret it’s not quite as simple as tallying up how many times you win or lose.  Instead, every time that you win, lose or draw against someone your current rank is compared to their current rank and then a number of points are either added to (in the case of a win or draw) or subtracted from (in the case of a loss or a draw) your rating.  Thus, nobody stays at the same rating for very long in the FIDE ranking system because every time that someone attends a tournament, they will win, lose and draw matches and thus, their rating will go up and down accordingly."

Essentially, a private search engine is a search engine that doesn’t track its users, and delivers search results with added layers of protection.  Search Encrypt is unique because it uses local encryption for an added layer of privacy protection.  Your search terms are transmitted to our servers in encrypted form, where they are decrypted and sent through our private search engine.

However, all of these methods can be affected by personal bias and perspective.  By using a psychometric test, you make a more objective and impartial judgment.  Since objectivity is key to using these assessments, a good psychometric test provides fair and accurate results each time it's given.  To ensure this, the test must meet these three key criteria: Standardization – The test must be based on results from a sample population that's truly representative of the people who'll be taking the test.  You can't realistically test every working person in a country.  But you can test a representative sample of that group, and then apply the results to the specific people whom you test.  Also, a standardized test is administered the same way every time to help reduce any test bias.  By using a standardized test, you can compare the results with anyone whose characteristics are similar to those of the sample group.  Reliability – The test must produce consistent results, and not be significantly influenced by outside factors."

41186,149_3-3,0,KILT_1398166-1,0,"Net neutrality  Network neutrality, or simply net neutrality, is the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) must treat all Internet communications equally, and not discriminate or charge differently based on user, content, website, platform, application, type of equipment, or method of communication.   With net neutrality, ISPs may not intentionally block, slow down, or charge money for specific online content.  Without net neutrality, ISPs may prioritize certain types of traffic, meter others, or potentially block traffic from specific services, while charging consumers for various tiers of service.   The term was coined by Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu in 2003, as an extension of the longstanding concept of a common carrier, which was used to describe the role of telephone systems.  Net neutrality regulations may be referred to as 'common carrier' regulations.  Net neutrality does not block all abilities that Internet service providers have to impact their customers' services.  Opt-in/opt-out services exist on the end user side, and filtering can be done on a local basis, as in the filtration of sensitive material for minors.   Research suggests that a combination of policy instruments will help realize the range of valued political and economic objectives central to the network neutrality debate."

Neutrality is not to be confused with neutralism, or nonalignment, under international law.  At the opening of hostilities, a nonbelligerent state generally issues a proclamation of neutrality.  It is then the duty of the neutral power to observe strict impartiality in its relations with the warring nations.  However, absolute neutrality is not always the reality, and the terms benevolent and hostile imply the sympathy of a neutral for one or other of the belligerents.  The duty of the belligerent is to respect neutral territory (land and air) and neutral territorial waters (see waters, territorial waters, territorial, all waters within the jurisdiction, recognized in international law, of a country.

Ecosocialism is a vision of a transformed society in harmony with nature, and the development of practices that can attain it.  It is directed toward alternatives to all socially and ecologically destructive systems, such as patriarchy, racism, homophobia and the fossil-fuel based economy.  It is based on a perspective that regards other species and natural ecosystems as valuable in themselves and as partners in a common destiny.  Ecosocialism shares with traditional socialism a passion for justice.  It shares the conviction that capitalism has been a deadly detour for humanity.  We understand capitalism to be a class society based on infinite expansion, through the exploitation of labor and the ransacking of nature.  Ecosocialists are also guided by the life-ways of indigenous peoples whose economies are embedded in a classless society in fundamental unity with nature.  We draw upon the wisdom of the ages as well as the latest science, and will do what can be done to bring a new society, beyond capitalism, into existence.  We recognize that ecosocialism on a global scale is a long way from being realized.  But it is on the horizon: far off, yet rising; indefinite yet vital, a terrain to be mapped, explored, and brought into existence."

PC(USA) had faced controversy for years over its liberal theology and disputes over the authority of the Bible.  In 2008, its General Assembly proposed allowing the ordination of partnered LGBT clergy.  This proposal was adopted in 2011, but it was opposed by evangelical Presbyterians.    In February 2011, a group of pastors issued a white paper that declared the PC(USA) 'deathly ill' and called for a new approach.  In August, the Fellowship of Presbyterians was formed as an umbrella organization of evangelicals in the Presbyterian Church (USA).  The Fellowship initiated plans for ECO in response to interest from pastors and congregations for a new Presbyterian denomination.  ECO was created to accommodate conservative Presbyterians that permitted the ordination of women.  While other conservative Presbyterian churches in the United States existed, most of these did not permit female clergy.   ECO was officially launched in January 2012 at a conference in Orlando, Florida.  It began accepting member congregations in April.  In the five years between 2012 and 2017, 303 former PC(USA) congregations joined ECO.   Section::::Beliefs."
