98_1,What is the environmental cost of food production?,CAR_af469eb9dc99af4caeaa0cc0a264e1a9f75132ea,"The term food security was first used in the 1960-1970s to refer to food supply and consistent access to food in international development work.  In 1966 the treaty titled the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was created to ensure economic, social and cultural rights including the “inalienable right to adequate nutritious food”.  In 1974 the World Food Conference focused on producing enough food for the world, ensuring the supply was reliable, and reducing dramatic price fluctuations.  Even early on it was clear that there was a great discrepancy between the world’s food supply and people’s access to food. Advances in agricultural technology in non-industrialized countries resulting in production of more food did not necessarily result in improved food access as evidenced by the Green Revolution. Rather, many environmental problems such as insecticide resistant pests, soil erosion, and pesticide poisoning of both people and wildlife resulted. During the 1980s and 1990s food security became recognized as a major public health concern in industrialized countries.  The concept of food entitlement was introduced in 1981 along with a shift in focus to ensured food access with adequate supply at the individual or household level in industrialized nations.  Food security was measured directly by anthropometric means or by food intake assessment, and indirectly by indicators of poverty, comparison of wages to food costs, employment rates and the use of emergency food programs.  At the 1996 World Food Summit, the Rome Declaration on World Food Security reaffirmed, “the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger”.  Throughout the 1980s and 1990s most responses to food insecurity tended to occur at the community level.

The majority of parasitoids for bumble bees are flies and about 30 percent or more bees within the area can be infected. The process of parasitism consists of the fly attaching to the bee in flight and inserting her oviposits between the terga of the bee. The larval fly hatches within the bee host and develops by feeding on the host’s tissues. The bee lives for about two weeks before dying. The fly then pupates and spends the winter inside the bee, fully developed, before it emerges the following year. North American bumblebees are also hosted by one parasitoid wasp and the moth, B. variabilis.  Hibernating queen bumble bees are parasitized by a nematode worm, Sphaerularia bombi. This parasite does not reduce life span, but instead causes the sterilization of the queen. It has been observed that affected queens forage two to three weeks later than those that are unaffected.  Parasitic microorganisms also use bees as their host. Parasitic microorganisms’ effects may be lethal or sublethal. Pathogens may be transmitted within a colony or the bee may be infected at flowers. Tracheal mites (Locustacarus buchneri) leads to reduced foraging efficiency by living in the bee’s alveoli. Certain protozoans and fungi consume the host tissue or gut substances of the bumble bee’s digestive tract, decreasing foraging efficiency, life span, and thus the colony fitness.

Injuries to Jerome Bettis and Duce Staley caused Willie Parker to become the Steelers' starter at running back, and he acquitted himself very well in two convincing wins against the Tennessee Titans (34–7) and Houston Texans (27–7) to open the season. In the next game, however, the visiting New England Patriots handed Ben Roethlisberger his first regular-season loss as the Steelers lost the much-hyped rematch of the 2004 AFC Championship Game 23–20. Two weeks later, Pittsburgh came back to defeat the throwback-clad San Diego Chargers 24–22 on a 40-yard field goal by Jeff Reed. The victory proved costly as Roethlisberger suffered an injury when he was hit on his left knee by the helmet of Chargers rookie lineman Luis Castillo.

The Steelers struggled throughout the game, as Maddox threw two interceptions through regulation, but they managed to tie at 17 going into OT. Maddox threw an interception to Jags DB Rashean Mathis, who returned it 41 yards for a touchdown, as the Steelers fell, 23–17.

Two of these are safeties, and two of them are cornerbacks. A cornerback's responsibilities vary depending on the type of coverage called. Coverage is simply how the defense will be protecting against the pass. The corners will generally line up 3 to 5 yards off the line of scrimmage, generally trying to 'Jam' or interrupt the receivers route within the first 5 yards.

Links in a food-web illustrate direct trophic relations among species, but there are also indirect effects that can alter the abundance, distribution, or biomass in the trophic levels.

89_9,How do predators and prey influence biodiversity?,CAR_3aeff5021142adb374072cf2d275eeceb541051f,"One major problem with both the diversity-productivity and diversity-stability debates discussed up to this point is that both focus on interactions at just a single trophic level. That is, they are concerned with only one level of the food web, namely plants. Other research, unconcerned with the effects of diversity, has demonstrated strong top-down forcing of ecosystems (see keystone species). There is very little actual data available regarding the effects of different food webs, but theory helps us in this area. First, if a food web in an ecosystem has a lot of weak interactions between different species, then it should have more stable populations and the community as a whole should be more stable. If upper levels of the web are more diverse, then there will be less biomass in the lower levels and if lower levels are more diverse they will better be able to resist consumption and be more stable in the face of consumption. Also, top-down forcing should be reduced in less diverse ecosystems because of the bias for species in higher trophic levels to go extinct first. Lastly, it has recently been shown that consumers can dramatically change the biodiversity-productivity-stability relationships that are implied by plants alone. Thus, it will be important in the future to incorporate food web theory into the future study of the effects of biodiversity. In addition this complexity will need to be addressed when designing biodiversity management plans.",4,"{'If upper levels of the web are more diverse, then there will be less biomass in the lower levels and if lower levels are more diverse they will better be able to resist consumption and be more stable in the face of consumption.', 'First, if a food web in an ecosystem has a lot of weak interactions between different species, then it should have more stable populations and the community as a whole should be more stable.', 'Lastly, it has recently been shown that consumers can dramatically change the biodiversity-productivity-stability relationships that are implied by plants alone.', 'Also, top-down forcing should be reduced in less diverse ecosystems because of the bias for species in higher trophic levels to go extinct first.', 'Other research, unconcerned with the effects of diversity, has demonstrated strong top-down forcing of ecosystems (see keystone species).'}","{'One major problem with both the diversity-productivity and diversity-stability debates discussed up to this point is that both focus on interactions at just a single trophic level.', 'In addition this complexity will need to be addressed when designing biodiversity management plans.', 'Thus, it will be important in the future to incorporate food web theory into the future study of the effects of biodiversity.', 'There is very little actual data available regarding the effects of different food webs, but theory helps us in this area.', 'That is, they are concerned with only one level of the food web, namely plants.'}",train,0,1

In 1870, twelve cuttings of the original tree were transplanted to Riverside, California, where the fruit became known as 'Washington'.

Drawing inspiration from Eric Clapton's short-lived (but influential) supergroup Cream, the band specialized, in concert, in improvisational jamming.

He found there was little difference between the sites because the garbage is compacted. The California landfills did have less paper than those in Illinois. Recycling is thought to be the cause of the paper difference between states. Rathje's research uncovered some other misconceptions about landfills. In particular, it was revealed that the rate of natural biodegradation is far slower than had been assumed (e.g., in capacity planning). It was found that the plastic bottles that were crushed at the top were able to be re-inflated easier than those that were at the bottom because of a new system of bottle making called light-weighting. This is the process of using less plastic in bottles to conserve material and save money. Light-weighting is not limited to plastic alone; this process is used for aluminum and paper as well. Rathje also found that Americans were wrong about what they thought they threw away most. When combined, the three most infamous types of trash—diapers, fast food containers, and Styrofoam—amounted to less than three percent of the landfill's waste. Rathje found that plastic was 20-24 percent of waste and paper alone was 40 percent of the waste found in landfills. Thirteen percent of this paper waste was from newspapers. Rathje states the irony of this fact in his book. He talks about how newspapers are usually the ones that report things such as waste and pollution and it is these same newspapers clogging the landfills. Rathje discusses the rate of closing landfills and how for every six small landfills closed one large landfill opens. At the time he published his book he predicted that in the next five years 50 percent of the landfills open at the time would close. He determined this from his findings. In an effort for states to prevent their area becoming a large landfill often states ship their trash to other states.

It was first included in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Snowboarding was one of five new sports or disciplines added to the Winter Olympic program between 1992 and 2002, and was the only one not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event. In 1998, four events, two for men and two for women, were held in two specialities: the giant slalom, a downhill event similar to giant slalom skiing; and the half-pipe, in which competitors perform tricks while going from one side of a semi-circular ditch to the other. Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the men's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding. Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after testing positive for marijuana. However, the IOC's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association. For the 2002 Winter Olympics, giant slalom was expanded to add head-to-head racing and was renamed parallel giant slalom. In 2006, a third event, the snowboard cross, was held for the first time. In this event, competitors race against each other down a course with jumps, beams and other obstacles.

Before snowboard specific boots existed, snowboarders used any means necessary to attach their feet to their snowboards and gain the leverage needed for turning. Typical boots used in these early days of snowboarding were Sorels or snowmobile boots. These boots were not designed for snowboarding and did not provide the support desired for doing turns on the heel edge of a snowboard. As a result, early innovators such as Louis Fournier conceived the 'high-back' binding design which was later commercialized and patented by Jeff Grell. The highback binding is the technology produced by most binding equipment manufacturers in the snowboard industry. The leverage provided by highbacks greatly improved board control. Snowboarders such as Craig Kelly adapted plastic 'tongues' to their boots to provide the same support for toe-side turns that the highback provided for heel-side turns.

The geographical name changed to Mount Bachelor in 1983 after the Bend Chamber of Commerce persuaded state and federal officials to adopt the more descriptive term 'mountain.' Well-known broadcaster and avid skier Lowell Thomas visited the young ski area in 1961, flying over from Sun Valley with J. R. Simplot.  The first chair lift was Black chair in 1961, shortly followed by the red chair lift in 1964. In 1967 and 1970 the yellow and blue chair lifts were added, and in 1973 the green and orange chair lifts were added.  The following lifts were added afterwards and the names continue to this day. These lifts include outback in 1976, rainbow in 1980, and sunrise in 1982. The first area of the mountain developed for skiing was the northeastern side. The northwestern side was not lift-served in 1973, but those who ventured for the 'Outback Trail Tour' paid a dollar in advance and got a return ride by a sno-cat to the lodge. A new trail was finished in 1975, and the Outback double chairlift was installed at a cost of $700,000. It was replaced by the $3 million high-speed quad (Outback Express) in the summer of 1987; with a capacity of 2,800 per hour. The lengthy Northwest Express chairlift was added in the summer of 1996, a high-speed quad with  vertical.

After the injury, he was left with the decision to either rehabilitate the shoulder or undergo season-ending surgery.

Cool Down Properly Personal trainer Cris Dobrosielski urges beginning runners to make a cool-down part of every workout.  It's a good habit to create right from the start.  Dobrosielski recommends a two-part cool-down that starts by slowing your running pace to a jog then to a walk until the heart rate comes back to normal.  The second part includes several static stretches to lengthen the hamstrings, calves, quadriceps and the muscles of the hips and lower back, holding each stretch for 10 to 60 seconds.

Can you lose weight just by running?  Sarah Lindsay, former Olympian and founder of Roar Fitness, warns against a regime of pure cardio, as you’re likely to lose muscle as well as fat, which doesn’t often work well as a long-term solution to maintaining a healthy body composition.  ‘When you’re burning calories, that energy comes from fat stores, glycogen stores and then protein – which is essentially muscle,’ explains Lindsay.  The higher your muscle mass, the higher your basal metabolic rate – in other words, less muscle means you need to eat less to get through the day.  ‘So, even if the calorie deficit you’ve created by running is helping you lose weight, as soon as you step out of that calorie deficit again, you’ll likely gain unhealthy fat.’  If you love to run, Lindsay says it’s a great way to increase overall calorie burn, as long as you also focus on preserving muscle through resistance exercise.  ‘Three strength-training sessions per week, along with one or two runs, is ideal,’ says Lindsay.",4,"{'Can you lose weight just by running?', 'Sarah Lindsay, former Olympian and founder of Roar Fitness, warns against a regime of pure cardio, as you’re likely to lose muscle as well as fat, which doesn’t often work well as a long-term solution to maintaining a healthy body composition.', '‘Three strength-training sessions per week, along with one or two runs, is ideal,’ says Lindsay.', '‘So, even if the calorie deficit you’ve created by running is helping you lose weight, as soon as you step out of that calorie deficit again, you’ll likely gain unhealthy fat.’  If you love to run, Lindsay says it’s a great way to increase overall calorie burn, as long as you also focus on preserving muscle through resistance exercise.'}","{'‘When you’re burning calories, that energy comes from fat stores, glycogen stores and then protein – which is essentially muscle,’ explains Lindsay.', 'The higher your muscle mass, the higher your basal metabolic rate – in other words, less muscle means you need to eat less to get through the day.', 'Fitbit Versa 2 Fitbit amazon.co.uk £146.99 SHOP NOW Garmin Instinct Garmin johnlewis.com £269.99 SHOP NOW Honor Band 5 Honor johnlewis.com £27.99 SHOP NOW Apple Watch 5 Apple johnlewis.com £329.00 SHOP NOW 3.'}",train,0,1

Should I run before or after dinner?  If you are going to run for less than an hour, you should run before dinner.  One of the reasons why we eat before dinner is to provide fuel for the muscles.  But the body already has a stored fuel source (muscle glycogen) that can be used in short-term, hard activities.  It’s probably better to eat after running to recover from it.  If you run too soon after dinner, you will be prone to stomach cramps, stomachaches, or gastrointestinal distress.  The mechanical movements of the body that naturally occurs while running can upset the digestive tract.  It's strongly recommended to wait three to four hours before running after eating a sumptuous dinner.  Do run at least 2 hours before bedtime to avoid endorphins to get in the way of your sleep.

Although you might burn slightly more fat than if you exercise after eating, your body won't pull all its necessary energy from the fat.  When you take protein from the muscles, you can't build your muscles effectively.  Also, as your body tries to draw energy from your digestive system, your blood sugar can lower and lead to nausea.  Symptoms Nausea is a common symptom of low blood sugar, which can occur when your body is seeking energy but none is readily available.  You might also feel dizzy or faint, which can be dangerous while working out.  You can fall or drop weights, injuring yourself or someone else.  If you start to feel faint, dizzy or nauseous, stop working out and sit down immediately.  Solution Eating just before you work out isn't the best solution, as your body pushes oxygenated blood to your digestive system to help it process food.  If your muscles compete with your digestive system during exercise, your food won't digest properly and you can begin to feel sick.

Training intensely on an empty stomach will demand caloric expenditure that the body cannot fully meet, leading to diminished returns.  Another benefit of eating before exercise is the thermogenic effect from the digestion of the food, which multiple studies have shown actually improves fat oxidation.  The process of digestion causes the body's temperature to rise, leading to a greater use of nutrients during exercise.  The high level of oxygen consumption during intense exercise intensifies this effect.  Indeed, it has been shown that greater use of both fat and carbohydrates occurs after consuming glucose before low- and high-intensity training when compared to not consuming glucose before exercise.

Several of those who exercise on an empty stomach — during their fasting window — however, have suffered from fatigue during their workouts, loss of muscle mass and difficulty recovering.  In her experience, people who work out during their fast may feel fine doing so at first but suffer a cumulative effect.  “People are trying to exercise and be productive throughout their day, and they are trying to do it on fumes,” she said.

Switch them on the next jump; and Duckie where you land with your heels apart and toes and knees pointing inwards, then on the next jump, point toes and knees out and heels together.  Little ones can play snake as long as your rope is long enough to allow distancing.  Put the rope on the floor and wiggle it, and then little ones can take turns jumping over it - perfect for littlies who haven't yet mastered the art of skipping.

It runs across the historical northern borders of China and runs from Dandong in the east to Lop Lake in the west.

139_2-15,What are the other natural wonders of the world besides the Great Barrier Reef?,MARCO_10_286700844-7,"In 1975 the government of Australia created the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park which gives protection to a large part of the reef system. Fishing and the removal of coral or artifacts is highly regulated.  Commercial shipping traffic is restricted to certain lanes that avoid the most sensitive parts of the park.  The park is a popular tourist destination and much of the management effort is directed at making sure these activities are ecologically sustainable.  Tourists can visit the reef on special glass bottomed boats or see it from the air by helicopter.  The most popular way to visit the reef, however, is by snorkelling or scuba diving.  Approximately two million people travel to the Great Barrier Reef each year which generates billions of dollars of economic activity for the region.  The Great Barrier Reef, along with many other coral reefs, is under threat from a number of environmental problems.

The Watergate scandal was about the funding and then the cover-up of a breakin at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington on 17 June 1972.

A traditional drink of Argentina is an infusion called mate (in Spanish, mate, with the accent on the first syllable).  The dried leaves and twigs of the yerba mate plant ( Ilex paraguariensis) are placed in a small cup, also called mate, usually made from a gourd, but also bone or horn.

Although it is now absorbed into Nigeria, traditional rulers of the state are still recognized.  The state occupied what is now the modern city of Calabar.   Section::::Origins and society.   The Efik speak a language in the Obolo subgroup of the Niger–Congo language group.   They had become a power on the coast of the Bight of Biafra by the early 18th century, by which time the Duke and Eyamba families were their leaders.   They were settled in large, fortified villages along the waterways, in a loose federation with no paramount ruler, living by fishing and farming.  The largest settlements were Ikot Itunko, Obutong and Iboku Atapka.  In the 19th century, the British renamed these as Creek Town, Old Town and Duke Town.   Section::::Religion.

143_1-1,"I hear a lot about banking innovation, but what is Open Banking regulation?",MARCO_44_737771076-2,"Understanding Open Banking Under open banking, banks allow access and control of customers personal and financial data to third-party service providers, which are typically tech startups and online financial service vendors. Customers are normally required to grant some kind of consent to let the bank allow such access, such as checking a box on a terms-of-service screen in an online app.  Third-party providers APIs can then use the customer's shared data (and data about the customer's financial counterparties).  Uses might include comparing the customer's accounts and transaction history to a range of financial service options, aggregating data across participating financial institutions and customers to create marketing profiles, or making new transactions and account changes on the customer's behalf.

A painfully shy teenager can reap lasting benefits when they learn to overcome these problems.  Building self-esteem depends much on teaching them to think more positively about themselves.  The ways teen therapy achieves this includes: 1.  Reducing negative thoughts, self-blame, and shame A good therapist allows your teen time to get to know themselves.  They will help them identify their negative self-talk, the past experiences that led to these beliefs, and how to combat them.  From there, your teen can learn tools to improve how they view themselves.  2  . Gaining empathy for themselves Improving their view of themselves includes developing self-compassion.  The therapist can guide them to treat themselves with the same kindness they offer to others.  Unlocking self-empathy gives your teen an opportunity to gain a better understanding of themselves and the issues they’re struggling with.  3.  Building positive thought patterns and perspectives Aside from combating negative thoughts, a therapist will also teach your teen to change negative self-talk into positive affirmations about themselves.",3,"{'Unlocking self-empathy gives your teen an opportunity to gain a better understanding of themselves and the issues they’re struggling with.', 'Building self-esteem depends much on teaching them to think more positively about themselves.', 'Building positive thought patterns and perspectives Aside from combating negative thoughts, a therapist will also teach your teen to change negative self-talk into positive affirmations about themselves.', 'They will help them identify their negative self-talk, the past experiences that led to these beliefs, and how to combat them.', 'The therapist can guide them to treat themselves with the same kindness they offer to others.', 'Reducing negative thoughts, self-blame, and shame A good therapist allows your teen time to get to know themselves.', 'Gaining empathy for themselves Improving their view of themselves includes developing self-compassion.'}","{'From there, your teen can learn tools to improve how they view themselves.', 'The ways teen therapy achieves this includes: 1.', '3.', 'A painfully shy teenager can reap lasting benefits when they learn to overcome these problems.', '2  .', '5 Ways Teen Therapy Can Help Build Self-Esteem Shyness can lead to a variety of problems for children, such as falling behind in school when they don’t dare talk to the teacher to ask questions.'}",train,0,1

Here are some of the easiest and useful tips on increasing your teenager’s self confidence.  1.  Show Respect: Do not forget – your teenager is not a child anymore and is a near-adult, and as such, deserves respect just like any other adult.  When you address your teenager, always show respect.  Do not let disdain or contempt show in your tone!  Always treat their problems and fears with importance.  Never shun off your teenager’s fears as a childhood worry.  [ Read: Common Problems Of Adolescence ] 2. Praise Often: You must praise your teenager often.  Be generous with your compliments.  When you praise your teenager for something good they did, it boosts their confidence in heaps and bounds.  It encourages them to do even better next time.

In a Ponzi scheme, investors are led to believe that their investment is earning returns in the market.  In reality, money is simply being unlawfully transferred from new investors and these returns exist only on paper.  Ponzi scheme investors have no knowledge that their gains have anything to do with new investors.  In a pyramid scheme, the participants are fully aware of the fact that they need to attract new investors into the operation in order to make money.  4.  The Scheme’s Sustainability A sophisticated Ponzi scheme can be extremely difficult to detect and can take years, sometimes even decades, to collapse.  For instance, Bernard Madoff’s scheme lasted for more than 35 years.  Pyramid schemes usually burn out very quickly.

When pollution causes changes in water quality or temperatures exceed their natural tolerances, corals will become stressed and may die if conditions don’t improve.  Stressors to coral reefs are: Rising water temperatures: Corals thrive in relatively warm water, but when water temperatures rise too high, the zooxanthellae are forced to leave.  Since these algae give the corals color, when they leave the coral becomes white, appearing bleached.This coral bleaching can cause the reef to die.  Ocean acidification: Ocean acidification can affect coral health by making less calcium carbonate available in ocean waters, making it harder for corals to form their skeletons.  Predation: Some species can cause damage to coral reefs, like damsel fish and crown of thorn starfish.  While they may not be invasive, outbreaks of these species can wreak havoc on reefs.  Overfishing: Coral reef ecosystems support an abundance of species, but overfishing can deplete these populations and effect the entire ecosystem.

After the elections and the inauguration, on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy and Congress set a new course for NASA, preempting existing developmental programs and schedules.  The United States, before the decade is out, should land 'a man on the Moon' and return him safely to Earth. 11 The Apollo program became the leading effort.  An orbital Space Station and Earth-to-orbit spacecraft, while they might contribute to a continuing presence in space and provide a platform for further lunar or planetary exploration, did not contribute to the short term goal of an American lunar landing within the decade.

After that, they will add the hydrogen gas to carbon dioxide that they’ve collected from either Mars or Earth and run them both through something called the Sebatier Process, which will produce methane, and water as a side product.  All that’s left is to liquify the methane and oxygen gas through a cryogenic system, and the rocket has all the fuel it needs!  Since SpaceX will use solar power to provide energy to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere on both Earth and Mars, this would have the effect of mitigating emissions here on our planet, as well as altering the atmosphere of Mars.  Furthermore, when the fuel burns, it releases water and carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, leaving both open to recollection.

The purpose of bikepacking bags and panniers is to carry luggage on your bike.  Generally speaking, bikepacking bags are made for off-road use while panniers and racks are made for road riding.  Racks and panniers are generally preferred by bicycle tourists who need to carry all of the necessities for weeks, months, or even years on the road.  Most bicycle tourists spend more time riding on the pavement and travel long distances.  Often internationally.  Bikepacking bags are often preferred by those who spend more time riding off-pavement, on long stretches of gravel roads, and single track through rural or wilderness regions.  Most bikepackers take a minimalist approach to packing to keep the bike lightweight and agile.  What are Bikepacking Bags?

Typically, bikepackers rely on handlebar packs, frame packs, seat packs and smaller peripheral packs.  Here is a round up of some popular seat packs, which should not be confused with the small, under-the-saddle wedge bags many of us use on daily rides to carry a patch kit, spare tube and a multi-tool.  Bikepacking seat packs are much larger bags designed to carry gear for a multi-day adventure.  They attach to the saddle rails and seat post and extend back behind the saddle and usually slightly upward for several inches.  Because of their size and location, they effectively also serve as rear fender.

149_3-3,"Um, what is search neutrality?",KILT_25606638-3,"Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial.
