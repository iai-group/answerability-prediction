Not only did he perform live on stage with Jimi Hendrix during 1968, he also played bass on the Jimi Hendrix song 'Voodoo Chile', from the Electric Ladyland album released in the same year (some copies of the album misspell his name as Cassidy). He also occasionally played with other key San Francisco bands Grateful Dead, Country Joe and the Fish and James and the Good Brothers. Furthermore, he was a member of two short-lived splinter groups, Mickey and the Heartbeats (with Jerry Garcia and Mickey Hart) and Jack Casady and the Degenerates, featuring friend from teen years Danny Gatton, as well as Jorma. Neither of these groups ever recorded, though live tapes are in circulation. Later, Casady was to appear on David Crosby's If I Could Only Remember My Name (1971), Roky Erickson's album Don't Slander Me (1982) and Warren Zevon's Transverse City (1989).
