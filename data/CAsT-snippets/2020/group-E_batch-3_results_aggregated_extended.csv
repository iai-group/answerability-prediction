In about 20 minutes, the main part of the garbage (organic matter), is converted into a kind of biomass, very clean, that you can touch with your hands, storable, and valid for composting, for gassification, or power generation (the calorific power is about 3.500 kcal/kg). The rest of materials like plastic or metals, are very easy to select once garbage has been processed into the Waste Cleaner.""]"
