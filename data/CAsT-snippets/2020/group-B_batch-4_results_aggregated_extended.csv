But in the fourth quarter, the Ravens took advantage of another key special teams play when Mitch Berger's punt went just 21 yards to the Baltimore 42-yard line. Flacco then led the Ravens 58 yards, completing 4 of 4 passes for 44 yards on the way to a 1-yard touchdown run by McGahee, cutting their deficit to 16–14. Baltimore's defense subsequently forced a punt and got the ball back on their own 14-yard line with just over six minutes left in the game. But four plays later, safety Troy Polamalu intercepted a pass from Flacco, ran all the way across the field, and took off for a 40-yard touchdown return, making the score 23–14. Pittsburgh then put the game away by forcing two more turnovers on the Ravens next two drives. First, a hit by Ryan Clark on McGahee forced a fumble that was recovered by linebacker Lawrence Timmons; McGahee suffered a concussion and was removed from the field on a stretcher. Then after a punt, Tyrone Carter intercepted a pass from Flacco with less than a minute left in the game.",,Tell me more about Polamalu's Interception versus Ravens in the 2008 AFC Championship game.,"[{""answer_confidence"":{""high"":False,""low"":False,""medium"":True,""very_high"":False,""very_low"":False},""passage-snippets-annotation-qualification-task"":{""entities"":[{""endOffset"":771,""label"":""relevant-text-span"",""startOffset"":616}]}}]",x,,"['safety Troy Polamalu intercepted a pass from Flacco, ran all the way across the field, and took off for a 40-yard touchdown return, making the score 2314.']"

In 1972, Pittsburgh finished 11–3 and won its first division title and its first playoff game—the 'Immaculate Reception' game against the Oakland Raiders.  During the season, Greene tallied eleven quarterback sacks and 42 solo tackles, and he was recognized as the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year. Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula lauded Greene, saying, 'He's just a super super star. It's hard to believe he isn't offside on every play. He makes the other team adjust to him.' By this time, Noll had built a formidable defense. 'We have maybe 10 guys now capable of making All-Pro,' said Greene in 1972. 'I'm just like all the other guys, doing my best in a team effort.'With the drafting of defensive tackle Ernie Holmes in 1972, the Steelers assembled what became known as the 'Steel Curtain' defensive line of Greene, Holmes, L. C. Greenwood, and Dwight White. Greene was invited to the Pro Bowl for 1973, joining White and Greenwood on the American Football Conference (AFC) roster.",1.0,Tell me more about Steelers' defense scheme.,"[{""answer_confidence"":{""high"":True,""low"":False,""medium"":False,""very_high"":False,""very_low"":False},""passage-snippets-annotation-qualification-task"":{""entities"":[{""endOffset"":1243,""label"":""relevant-text-span"",""startOffset"":1049}]}}]",x,,"[""'With the drafting of defensive tackle Ernie Holmes in 1972, the Steelers assembled what became known as the 'Steel Curtain' defensive line of Greene, Holmes, L.
