Praise Their Good Work: Keep it sincere, but don’t hesitate to tell your teen when you see he or she is doing a great job.  Also, take note of their good decision-making skills, and empower them to trust their own judgment when making decisions rather than always turning to a friend for a second opinion.  Celebrate with them when they achieve a goal.  Criticize Constructively: You may not know how much criticism your teens are facing online, so be careful with how you criticize.  Take care to be constructive, and avoid demeaning or shaming your child.  Pick your battles: in the end, maybe it doesn’t matter that he’s wearing the same shirt for the third day in a row.

And the more healthy risks they can take and succeed at, will lead to them being more confident in their ability to tackle tougher risks in their future.  7 – Use Mistakes As a Learning Experience A POSITIVE learning experience.  You gave them a choice, you let them take a risk… and they failed.  It’s OK!  For you and for them.  Failing is a part of life.  Every mistake made is a learning experience to do it differently the next time.  As long as you are using their mistakes to positively encourage them.  Tell them how proud you are that they took the risk.  Explain to them its ok to fail sometimes.  And discuss what they can do different the next time.

Common Types of Elder Abuse The following are some of the most common types of elder financial exploitation and how to protect yourself or an elder you know.  Scams Scams have distinguishing factors that you should be aware of: A 'Hook': something to attract you and cause you to pay less attention to the details.  Manipulation: scammers manipulate people into trusting them.  A Deadline: if a solicitation has a strict deadline that gives you little time to make a decision, it is likely a scam.  Sweepstakes Scams Notifications that you've won a sweepstake are often scams.  One way these notifications trick elders is by using a name which sounds like a government agency or official-sounding authority.  If, as the 'winner' of a sweepstake, you are asked to pay taxes and fees by sending a check or wiring money, this is likely a scam.  A sweepstake may ask for your banking information to direct deposit your 'winnings.'  This is an attempt to steal your identity and access the money in your bank account, not deposit money.  Protective Measure: Remember that legitimate sweepstakes do not ask for money upfront from winners!",1.0,What else about scams should I be aware of asides from guaranteed returns?,"[{""answer_confidence"":{""high"":False,""low"":False,""medium"":False,""very_high"":True,""very_low"":False},""passage-snippets-annotation-qualification-task"":{""entities"":[{""endOffset"":483,""label"":""relevant-text-span"",""startOffset"":397},{""endOffset"":545,""label"":""relevant-text-span"",""startOffset"":500},{""endOffset"":666,""label"":""relevant-text-span"",""startOffset"":560}]}}]",x,,"["" A 'Hook': something to attract you and cause you to pay less attention to the details"", 'scammers manipulate people into trusting them', 'if a solicitation has a strict deadline that gives you little time to make a decision, it is likely a scam']"

Vivek Kaul April 15, 2013 18:46:18 IST Charles Ponzi, the man on whom Ponzi schemes have been named, has been dead for more than sixty years.  And after all these years, it looks like that the world may have finally found a successor to Ponzi.  His name is Sergei Mavrodi and he is a Russian.  But before he get to Mavrodi, lets first try and understand what a Ponzi scheme is.  MMM became a market maker for these share certificates.  The money collected by selling share certificates to the investors was not invested but essentially used to pay off the investors, selling the share certificates back to MMM Charles Ponzi, an Italian immigrant into the United States, promised investors in Boston that he would double their money (i.e. give them a 100% return on their investment) in 90 days.",3.0,So is this scam that offers 20% monthly interest on my money a Ponzi scheme?,"[{""answer_confidence"":{""high"":False,""low"":False,""medium"":True,""very_high"":False,""very_low"":False},""passage-snippets-annotation-qualification-task"":{""entities"":[{""endOffset"":337,""label"":""relevant-text-span"",""startOffset"":171}]}}]",,The agreement rate not met.
