Coral reefs host an abundant and diverse array of marine life.  Corals themselves are living organisms on which the whole ecosystem depends.  Much like a forest on land, corals build their hard stony skeletons over years and years, resulting in a complex habitat that makes a great home for sea creatures.  Coral reefs provide habitat and food for a large variety of marine life, including various sponges, oysters, clams, crabs, starfish, sea urchins, and many species of fish.  Coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse and valuable ecosystems on Earth.  An estimated 25 percent of all marine life, including over 4,000 species of fish, are dependent on coral reefs at some point in their life cycle.

However, some of that difference is made up for by wildfires that burn plant matter and release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, much like cellular respiration does.  Wildfires make up for most of that difference, but not quite.  A very small amount of organic material is buried under sediment and taken out of the short-term carbon cycle that cycles carbon between living organisms, the atmosphere and the surface of the oceans.  This buried organic material may eventually be turned into fossil fuels, but that's not the only way that carbon can be taken out of the short-term carbon cycle.  Coral reefs take carbon out of the short-term carbon cycle to form calcium carbonate exoskeletons  Believe it or not, on a net basis, coral reefs actually take the most carbon out of the short-term carbon cycle.  This is achieved by the formation of calcium carbonate exoskeletons, which do not release carbon back into the water, but instead remain in a solid form and eventually form limestone.
