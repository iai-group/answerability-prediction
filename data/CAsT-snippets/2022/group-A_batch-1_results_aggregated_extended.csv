The updated Paris Agreement commitments will be reviewed at the climate change conference known as COP 26 in Glasgow, UK in November 2021.  This conference will be the most important intergovernmental meeting on the climate crisis since the Paris agreement was passed in 2015.  The success or otherwise of this conference will have stark consequences for the world.  If countries cannot agree on sufficient pledges, in another 5 years, the emissions reduction necessary will leap to a near-impossible 15.5% every year.  The unlikelihood of achieving this far steeper rate of decarbonization means the world faces a global temperature increase that will rise above 1.5°C.  Every fraction of additional warming above 1.5°C will bring worsening impacts, threatening lives, food sources, livelihoods and economies worldwide.  Countries are not on track to fulfill the promises they have made.  Increased commitments can take many forms but overall they must serve to shift countries and economies onto a path of decarbonization, setting targets for net-zero carbon, and timelines of how to reach that target, most typically through a rapid acceleration of energy sourced from renewables and rapid deceleration of fossil fuel dependency.",,"I remember Glasgow hosting COP26 last year, but unfortunately I was out of the loop.

The situation is compounded by poor reliability of, and access to, climate data and information to support adaptation actions.

Climate change affects regions across the globe, however, people living in poverty are more affected despite the fact that the 50 least developed countries in the world contribute only 1 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.  Climate change can bring about disastrous weather events, of which 99 percent of total fatalities and 90 percent of all economic losses occur in less developed countries.  Because of their already vulnerable state, poor communities are particularly at risk of feeling the effects of climate change.

Developed countries will continue to mobilize $100 billion per year from 2020 to 2025 to support low-carbon growth and climate resilience in developing countries, building on the commitment from the Copenhagen Accord.  By 2025, countries will set a new collective quantified goal for climate finance for at least $100 billion per year.  Developing countries are encouraged to provide climate finance on a voluntary basis - giving recognition to the broadening donor pool for international climate finance.  Cycles for Review and Commitments The finance commitment for $100 billion in annual climate finance from 2020-2025 and timeline for future finance helps to ensure that we are continually ramping-up climate finance to assist the most vulnerable countries.
