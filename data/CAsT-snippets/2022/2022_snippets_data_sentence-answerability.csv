It’s a good movement for improving your balance and coordination too.  How to do it: Stand with your feet together and a medicine ball in your hands.  Lift the ball up and overhead.  Brace your core.  Take a long step forward, bend your legs, and lower your rearmost knee down to within an inch of the floor.  Simultaneously lower the medicine ball down and to the outside of your leading leg, twisting your torso to that side.  Push off your front leg and return to the starting position, lifting the medicine ball back up as you do.  Step out with the opposite leg and repeat on the other side.  2.

As you take each step, jump forward with your front leg, landing slightly off to the side.  Continue to move forward by alternating legs, as if you were running in slow motion.

During the deload week, you train with weights that are lighter than normal.  Shoot for 60 percent of your 1RM, and reduce the number of reps by half.  You can also take a week off (just like what I did last week), and don’t even go near the gym or running track.  Instead, keep it light.  Do yoga, walk, swim, or get a massage.  Bonus – A Runner Upper Body Workout Here’s a simple workout routine that will sculpt all of the major muscles in your upper body.  Perform this routine two to three days a week, leaving a rest day in between.  Finish the suggested number of reps for each exercise.

135_2-11,So is it best to avoid running on an empty stomach as a leisure athlete?,MARCO_45_1345109635-3,"If glucose stores are low after several hours of fasting, your body may break down your lean muscle mass for fuel, defeating the purpose of your workout. Your training status, stores of intramuscular fat and the capacity of your muscles to store glucose in the form of glycogen are primary determinants of energy pathways during intense exercise.  Keep Your Mind Sharp Exercising without eating first can lead to low blood glucose, which can interfere with your brain function.  When you eat, glucose levels in your circulating blood rise and are available to travel to your muscle cells.  Glucose is also available as glycogen stored in your muscles.  When you work out before eating, glycogen and blood glucose can become quickly depleted, causing hypoglycemia.  Because glucose is the only fuel that your brain can use directly, low levels may cause lightheadedness, nausea, muscle fatigue and poor exercise performance.

Should I run before or after dinner?  If you are going to run for less than an hour, you should run before dinner.  One of the reasons why we eat before dinner is to provide fuel for the muscles.  But the body already has a stored fuel source (muscle glycogen) that can be used in short-term, hard activities.  It’s probably better to eat after running to recover from it.  If you run too soon after dinner, you will be prone to stomach cramps, stomachaches, or gastrointestinal distress.  The mechanical movements of the body that naturally occurs while running can upset the digestive tract.  It's strongly recommended to wait three to four hours before running after eating a sumptuous dinner.  Do run at least 2 hours before bedtime to avoid endorphins to get in the way of your sleep.  All runners' stomachs are different Every runner has a different level of tolerance on how they stomach will react after they have their meals.

Although you might burn slightly more fat than if you exercise after eating, your body won't pull all its necessary energy from the fat.  When you take protein from the muscles, you can't build your muscles effectively.  Also, as your body tries to draw energy from your digestive system, your blood sugar can lower and lead to nausea.  Symptoms Nausea is a common symptom of low blood sugar, which can occur when your body is seeking energy but none is readily available.  You might also feel dizzy or faint, which can be dangerous while working out.  You can fall or drop weights, injuring yourself or someone else.  If you start to feel faint, dizzy or nauseous, stop working out and sit down immediately.  Solution Eating just before you work out isn't the best solution, as your body pushes oxygenated blood to your digestive system to help it process food.

For those who are sticklers for science and want to do what the research has proven, know that the jury is still out on which is really better.  Researchers found no major difference in body composition or weight loss in those groups of those worked out before or after breakfast.  Further research suggests no performance limitations for the average runner going out at a relaxed pace for a short run before eating.  It is more important to replenish glucose sources after the run.  This is when the runner should eat a meal rich in carbohydrates and include some protein to recover.  The problem is that some runners are short on time after getting their early morning run in.  They might not yet be hungry enough to eat yet or simply in a rush.  But eating after is crucial.

Training intensely on an empty stomach will demand caloric expenditure that the body cannot fully meet, leading to diminished returns.  Another benefit of eating before exercise is the thermogenic effect from the digestion of the food, which multiple studies have shown actually improves fat oxidation.  The process of digestion causes the body's temperature to rise, leading to a greater use of nutrients during exercise.  The high level of oxygen consumption during intense exercise intensifies this effect.  Indeed, it has been shown that greater use of both fat and carbohydrates occurs after consuming glucose before low- and high-intensity training when compared to not consuming glucose before exercise.  If your goal is muscle growth or maintenance, fueling up is doubly important.  Going into cardiovascular training hungry puts you at risk of significant loss of protein.

It is prepared from steeping dried leaves of yerba mate in hot water.  Mate is served with a metal straw from a shared hollow calabash gourd.  The straw is called a bombilla in some Latin American countries, a bomba in Portuguese, and a bombija or, more generally, a masassa in Arabic.  The straw is traditionally made of silver.  Modern, commercially available straws are typically made of nickel silver, called Alpaca; stainless steel, or hollow-stemmed cane.

But we believe there are important differences.  Open banking is when a bank, upon a customer’s request, shares customer data with third parties via APIs.  6 Open banking does not use other, less secure methods of data-sharing, such as screen scraping, CSV files, or OCR-readable statements.  There are two types of open APIs: read access, which only gives access to account information, or write access, which enables payments.  7 Open banking can be mandated through government regulations, as it is in the United Kingdom and the European Union Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), or its adoption can be industry-driven, as is the case now in the United States. 8 Open banking is built upon the premise that customers own the data they generate and have the right to direct banks to share their data with others they trust.  While it was designed to give customers more choice, open banking may end up making customers better understand and appreciate the value of one of their key assets: their data.",3,"{'7 Open banking can be mandated through government regulations, as it is in the United Kingdom and the European Union Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), or its adoption can be industry-driven, as is the case now in the United States.'}","{'Open banking is when a bank, upon a customer’s request, shares customer data with third parties via APIs.', '8 Open banking is built upon the premise that customers own the data they generate and have the right to direct banks to share their data with others they trust.', '6 Open banking does not use other, less secure methods of data-sharing, such as screen scraping, CSV files, or OCR-readable statements.', 'Practitioners around the globe frequently use ”open banking” as an umbrella term that encompasses both open banking and platform banking.', 'While it was designed to give customers more choice, open banking may end up making customers better understand and appreciate the value of one of their key assets: their data.', 'But we believe there are important differences.', 'There are two types of open APIs: read access, which only gives access to account information, or write access, which enables payments.'}"

There are many secondary effects of climate change and sea level rise particular to island nations.  According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service climate change in the Pacific Islands will cause 'continued increases in air and ocean surface temperatures in the Pacific, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and increased rainfall during the summer months and a decrease in rainfall during the winter months'.  This would entail distinct changes to the small, diverse, and isolated island ecosystems and biospheres present within many of these island nations.  As sea level rises island nations are at increased risk of losing coastal arable land to degradation as well as salinification.  Once the limited available soil on these islands is salinified it becomes very difficult to produce subsistence crops such as breadfruit.  This would severely impact the agricultural and commercial sector in nations such as the Marshall Islands and Kiribati.  In addition, local fisheries would also be severely affected by higher ocean temperatures and increased ocean acidification.  As ocean temperatures rise and the pH of oceans decreases, many fish and other marine species would die out or change their habits and range.

Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on consensus building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets.

This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, and Somalia, as well as to Small Island Developing States.  In the cases where developing countries produce only small quantities of greenhouse gas emissions per capita but are very vulnerable to the negative effects of global warming, the term 'forced riders' as opposed to the 'free riders' has been used as a descriptor.  Such countries include Comoros, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.  Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.

Although the earth’s climate has been changing since its formation, temperatures have been rising rapidly since the industrial revolution.  By burning fossil fuels, humans increase emissions (greenhouse gasses that are trapped in earth’s atmosphere) like carbon dioxide and methane.  These emissions trap energy in the atmosphere and increase the temperature of the earth.  Temperatures have risen about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit in the last century.  Climate change affects regions across the globe, however, people living in poverty are more affected despite the fact that the 50 least developed countries in the world contribute only 1 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.

A painfully shy teenager can reap lasting benefits when they learn to overcome these problems.  Building self-esteem depends much on teaching them to think more positively about themselves.  The ways teen therapy achieves this includes: 1.  Reducing negative thoughts, self-blame, and shame A good therapist allows your teen time to get to know themselves.  They will help them identify their negative self-talk, the past experiences that led to these beliefs, and how to combat them.  From there, your teen can learn tools to improve how they view themselves.  2  . Gaining empathy for themselves Improving their view of themselves includes developing self-compassion.  The therapist can guide them to treat themselves with the same kindness they offer to others.  Unlocking self-empathy gives your teen an opportunity to gain a better understanding of themselves and the issues they’re struggling with.  3.  Building positive thought patterns and perspectives Aside from combating negative thoughts, a therapist will also teach your teen to change negative self-talk into positive affirmations about themselves.",3,"{'Unlocking self-empathy gives your teen an opportunity to gain a better understanding of themselves and the issues they’re struggling with.', 'Building self-esteem depends much on teaching them to think more positively about themselves.', 'Building positive thought patterns and perspectives Aside from combating negative thoughts, a therapist will also teach your teen to change negative self-talk into positive affirmations about themselves.', 'They will help them identify their negative self-talk, the past experiences that led to these beliefs, and how to combat them.', 'The therapist can guide them to treat themselves with the same kindness they offer to others.', 'Reducing negative thoughts, self-blame, and shame A good therapist allows your teen time to get to know themselves.', 'Gaining empathy for themselves Improving their view of themselves includes developing self-compassion.'}","{'From there, your teen can learn tools to improve how they view themselves.', 'The ways teen therapy achieves this includes: 1.', '3.', 'A painfully shy teenager can reap lasting benefits when they learn to overcome these problems.', '2  .', '5 Ways Teen Therapy Can Help Build Self-Esteem Shyness can lead to a variety of problems for children, such as falling behind in school when they don’t dare talk to the teacher to ask questions.'}"

Older kids probably won’t welcome constructive criticism, but can be taught ways to manage feedback from a variety of sources.  Teens and young adults are still learning how to handle constructive criticism and apply it to life.  Who should give constructive criticism to kids?  Parents and caregivers are the first to provide constructive criticism to kids.  Later, teachers and coaches will join the crowd.  Criticism is easier to handle when it comes from someone who cares for the child.  Kind words ensure the child knows the critique comes from a place of love.  Starting early can help children learn to cope with feedback in a healthy way.  Try not to criticize children in a way that makes them feel bad.  Instead, help them see life’s natural consequences and give age-appropriate examples.  Help little ones understand that when given in a caring way, constructive criticism is just a way for things to be better.  It’s easy to implement simple examples in the home.

For example, Bernie Madoff provided investors with consistent return of 1-1.5% per month for 10 years before everything fell apart.  (For more, see: Avoiding Online Investment Scams.)  Be extra-cautious if the returns are being generated by something you never heard of or in a way that's impossible to follow.  2  . Be Suspicious of Unsolicited Offers Someone contacting you unexpectedly, perhaps inviting you to an investment seminar, is often a red flag.

The SEC advises that there are several warning signs that investors can use to help avoid being victimized by high-yield investment program scams.  These include excessive guaranteed returns, fictitious financial instruments, extreme secrecy, claims that the investments are an exclusive opportunity, and inordinate complexity surrounding the investments.  Perpetrators of high-yield investment programs use secrecy and a lack of transaction transparency to hide the fact that there are no legitimate underlying investments.  The best weapon against getting sucked into a high-yield investment program is to ask a lot of questions and use common sense.  If an investment’s return sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  1 ﻿ High-Yield Investment Program (HYIP)  Example An example of an HYIP was ZeekRewards, run by Paul Burks and shut down by the SEC in August 2012.

Money is not invested and no actual underlying returns are earned; new money is just used to pay people who entered the scam earlier than they did.  Though this brand of Ponzi scheme has existed since the early 20th century, the proliferation of digital communications technology has made it much easier for con artists to operate such scams.  Usually, an operator will create a website to lure in unsuspecting investors, promising very high returns but remaining vague about the underlying management of the investment fund, how the money is to be invested, or where the fund is located.  These funds typically involve the alleged trading or issuance of “prime” bank financial instruments and may include references to prime European or prime world bank instruments.

141_2-11,What other similar schemes to Ponzi are there?,MARCO_40_212205144-8,"Ponzi schemes often share common characteristics, such as offering overly consistent returns, unregistered investments, high returns with little or no risk, or secretive or complex strategies. Pyramid schemes: In these schemes, as in Ponzi schemes, money collected from new participants is paid to earlier participants.  In pyramid schemes, however, participants receive commissions for recruiting new participants into the scheme.  Pyramid schemes are frequently disguised as multi-level marketing programs.  Prime bank investment fraud/trading program fraud: In these schemes, perpetrators claim to have access to a secret trading program endorsed by large financial institutions such as the Federal Reserve Bank, Treasury Department, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, etc. Victims are often drawn into prime bank investment frauds because the criminals use sophisticated terms and legal-looking documents, and also claim that the investments are insured against loss.

Ask what your dive shop, boating store, tour operators, hotel and other coastal businesses are doing to save the coral reefs.  This is especially important in coastal areas with reefs.  Let them know you are an informed consumer and care about reefs.  2  . Don't use chemically enhanced pesticides and fertilizers.  Although you may live thousands of miles from a coral reef ecosystem, these products end up in the watershed and may ultimately impact the waters that support coral.  3. Volunteer for a reef cleanup.  You don't live near a coral reef?  Then do what many people do with their vacation: visit a coral reef.  Spend an afternoon enjoying the beauty of one of the world's treasures while helping to preserve it for future generations.  4. Learn more about coral reefs.

Section::::Open cycle versus closed cycle.:Open cycle designs.   The disadvantage of the open cycle is that the fuel can escape with the working fluid through the nozzle before it reaches significant burn-up levels.  Thus, finding a way to limit the loss of fuel is required for open-cycle designs.  Unless an outside force is relied upon (i.e. magnetic forces, rocket acceleration), the only way to limit fuel-propellant mixing, is through flow hydrodynamics.  Another problem is that the radioactive efflux from the nozzle makes the design totally unsuitable for operation within Earth's atmosphere.

144_2-9,Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?,MARCO_18_2918414305-9,"However, hydrogen also has these disadvantages: Very low density (about 1⁄7 of the density of kerosene) – requiring a very large tank Deeply cryogenic – must be stored at very low temperatures and thus needs heavy insulation Escapes very easily from the smallest gap Wide combustible range – easily ignited and burns with a dangerously invisible flame Tends to condense oxygen which can cause flammability problems Has a large coefficient of expansion for even small heat leaks. These issues can be dealt with, but at extra cost.  While kerosene tanks can be 1% of the weight of their contents, hydrogen tanks often must weigh 10% of their contents.  This is because of both the low density and the additional insulation required to minimize boiloff (a problem which does not occur with kerosene and many other fuels).  The low density of hydrogen further affects the design of the rest of the vehicle: pumps and pipework need to be much larger in order to pump the fuel to the engine.  The end result is the thrust/weight ratio of hydrogen-fueled engines is 30–50% lower than comparable engines using denser fuels.

The stark difference between the two, though, is the presence of pavement.  Bike touring sticks to roads, but where the pavement ends, bikepacking begins.  By abandoning asphalt, the bikepacker loses many associated byproducts as well: the presence of vehicles, crowds of people, and the infrastructure of cities and towns.

146_1-3,What are bike packing bags?,MARCO_18_438706474-27,"Bikepacking Bikepacking is a self-supported style of lightly-loaded single or multiple night mountain biking. Bikepacking is similar to bike touring, however the two sports generally use different bikes and the main difference is the method of carrying gear.  Bikepacking generally involves carrying less gear and using smaller frame bags while bike touring will use panniers.  A typical bikepacking set-up includes a frame bag, handlebar roll, seat pack, and backpack and typical gear includes lightweight and basic camping gear, and a bike repair kit.  Mountain bikes are generally used as many bike packing destinations are reached via forest-service roads or singletrack trails.  Mountain bikes specific to bike-packing use a slightly taller frame to get the maximum frame bag capacity.  This is achieved by using a longer headtube, a more horizontal top tube, and a reduced stem degree.  Generally, bikepackers tend to cover anywhere from 25 to 75 miles (40 – 120 km) in a given day as the riding can be technical.

Bikepacking seat packs are much larger bags designed to carry gear for a multi-day adventure.

She explains that minorities and women aren’t fairly represented on the internet.  This is also an issue with the search engines that people use to find information on the internet.  One counterargument though, is that the search engines themselves aren’t the problem.  If the information they are crawling is biased, that same bias will be introduced into their search results.  “When we start getting into more complicated concepts around identity, around knowledge, this is where search engines start to fail us.  This wouldn’t be so much of a problem except that the public really relies upon search engines to give them what they think will be the truth, or something vetted, or something that’s credible” Noble said.

This method of personalizing web content results in filter bubbles, a term coined by digital activist Eli Pariser that refers to the polarized ideological bubbles that are created by computer algorithms filtering out unrelated information and opposing views.  A 2011 study found ideological segregation of online news consumption is lower than the segregation of most offline news consumption and lower than the segregation of face-to-face interactions.  This suggests that the filter bubbles effects of online media consumption are exaggerated.  Other research also shows that online media does not contribute to the increased polarization of opinions.
