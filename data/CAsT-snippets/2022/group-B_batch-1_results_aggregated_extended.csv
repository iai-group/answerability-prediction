The argument that the universe is a simulation is based on flawed reasoning and bad science.  Tim Andersen, Ph.D. May 27, 2020 · 8 min read They all believe it.  Elon Musk says it’s almost certain.  Scientists such as Neil deGrasse Tyson and philosophers such as Nick Bostrom argue that our universe is likely a simulation, running on sophisticated computing hardware in a “real” universe, the plaything of the Godlike beings who created us.  While researchers at Oxford have experimentally shown that the universe cannot be simulated using classical algorithms, it remains to be seen whether more advanced, quantum computing methods could.  But philosophically, these arguments are based on a flawed belief in the reality of Bayesian probability, which falsely imposes our own mental constructs on reality to prove things about nature.

It could contain conscious minds which may or may not be fully aware that they are living inside a simulation.  This is quite different from the current, technologically achievable concept of virtual reality.  Virtual reality is easily distinguished from the experience of actuality; participants are never in doubt about the nature of what they experience.  Simulated reality, by contrast, would be hard or impossible to separate from 'true' reality.  There has been much debate over this topic, ranging from philosophical discourse to practical applications in computing.   Section::::Arguments.   Section::::Arguments.:Simulation argument.

Perhaps it would seem improper to create simulated beings that believe they exist and have autonomy.  But that too seems unlikely, Smoot says.
