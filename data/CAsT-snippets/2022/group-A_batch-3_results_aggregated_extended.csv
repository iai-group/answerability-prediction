After the elections and the inauguration, on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy and Congress set a new course for NASA, preempting existing developmental programs and schedules.  The United States, before the decade is out, should land 'a man on the Moon' and return him safely to Earth. 11 The Apollo program became the leading effort.  An orbital Space Station and Earth-to-orbit spacecraft, while they might contribute to a continuing presence in space and provide a platform for further lunar or planetary exploration, did not contribute to the short term goal of an American lunar landing within the decade.  NASA readjusted its schedules and priorities to accommodate Apollo.  The Space Station and the reusable aerospace craft remained viable, but future, options.  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), in particular, continued to study the reusable vehicle concept and as early as January 1963, developed a statement of work for a fully reusable rocket-powered vehicle that could carry civilian passengers, and a sizable payload.

After the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs.  Max Faget, a NASA engineer who had worked to design the Mercury capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.  The Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory argued that a straight-wing design would not be able to withstand the high thermal and aerodynamic stresses during reentry, and would not provide the required cross-range capability.

Musk stated in May 2013 that the goal of the program is to achieve full and rapid reusability of the first stage by 2015, and to develop full launch vehicle reusability following that as 'part of a future design architecture'.   In February 2014, SpaceX made explicit that the newly defined super-heavy launch vehicle for what was then called Mars Colonial Transporter would also make use of the reusable technology.   This was consistent with Musk's strategic statement in 2012 that 'The revolutionary breakthrough will come with rockets that are fully and rapidly reusable.  We will never conquer Mars unless we do that.  It'll be too expensive.  The American colonies would never have been pioneered if the ships that crossed the ocean hadn't been reusable.'   Also in May 2014, SpaceX publicly announced an extensive test program for a related reusable technology: a propulsively-landed space capsule called 'DragonFly'.  The tests were to be run in Texas at the McGregor Rocket Test Facility in 2014–2015.

While more complex than solid fuel, the ability to control the ﬂow of propellant means the engine can be throttled to a particular speed.  Liquid fuels are further subcategorised into either petroleum, cryogens or hypergols.  Petroleum is fuel derived from crude oil and hydrocarbons.  You would not fuel your car with this stuff!  Rocket-grade petroleum is called RP-1 and consists of a highly refined kerosene mixed with liquid oxygen.  Cryogens are those stored at very low temperatures (such as liquid hydrogen) Hypergols are able to self-ignite on contact between the fuel and the oxidiser.  These fuels simply needs nitric acid in order to ignite and are frequently used for propulsion when out in space.  Another liquid fuel is alcohol.

If the mission velocity and payload are low, the propellants are fed to the thrust chamber by pressurizing the vehicle tanks.  As the mission velocity requirement increases, the chamber pressure must be increased to raise the thrust from each pound of propellant in order to increase the vehicle thrust-to-weight ratio.  This justifies the added complexity of the turbopumps to minimize the vehicle tank weight.  The type of engine cycle selected also influences the turbopump requirements and configuration.

Most of this heat is expelled along with the gas that contains it; however, heat is transferred to the thrust chamber walls in quantities sufficient to require attention.

The various Dragon capsules use the “ Draco ” and “ SuperDraco ” engines.  The Draco’s use a “hypergolic” fuel which means that you mix two chemicals and they spontaneously combust - without needing any kind of ignition source.  Both rockets use monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide.  When they fire, the exhaust is a very characteristic bright orange.  The StarShip and SuperHeavy use the “Raptor” engines.  Raptor uses liquid Methane (LCH4) as the fuel with liquid Oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer (this is sometimes called “Methalox”).  WHY SWITCH TO METHANE?  The switch from RP-1 to Methane comes about because SpaceX want to fly StarShip to Mars - and if they do that, there won’t be enough room on board to store enough fuel to get home again.  The nice thing about Methane is that it can be made from CO2 and Hydrogen - plus a good supply of electricity.

[ 5] Hydrogen density is 0.071 g/ml, whereas the density of Kerosene (RP-1) is 0.820 g/ml.  In short, LH2 is 12 times less dense than Kerosene.  Therefore, an LH2 tank would be bigger in volume for the necessary propellant than an RP-1 rocket tank.  As a result, tank weight would be more and less aerodynamic.  [ 6] Moreover, to prevent liquid Hydrogen from boiling off, the rockets need insulation from all heat sources, such as rocket engine exhaust, air friction during launch, and radiant heat from the sun.  Hydrogen rockets need advanced metallurgy to prevent hydrogen embrittlement.  Metals become brittle when exposed to the extreme cold of liquid Hydrogen.  It also leaks very easily.  Liquid Hydrogen can leak through tiny pores in welded joints.  Liquid Hydrogen is costly too.  An enormous amount of technical expertise is necessary to solve all these problems.

As we can see, though Hydrogen is more efficient, it has many drawbacks.  Therefore, SpaceX needs a rocket engine that does not have these issues.  When they first started designing an engine, SpaceX did not want to take any risk of creating a completely new type of engine that no one developed.  Therefore, they decided to use Kerosene (RP-1) for their Falcon family rockets.  When they were successful with their Marlin engine, they started their R&D for the Methane powered Raptor.  In short, liquid Hydrogen needs extreme temperature control, leaks easily, less dense, thus requires a bigger fuel tank, expensive compared to Methane, not suitable for a reusable rocket and Mars mission, needs advanced metallurgy; hence, it increases rocket complexity and cost.  Therefore, SpaceX made the right decision by not developing a Hydrogen rocket engine.
