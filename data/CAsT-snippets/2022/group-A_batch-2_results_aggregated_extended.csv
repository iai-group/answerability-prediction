'What a Wonderful World' was credited to George Douglas or Stanley Clayton.  These are pseudonyms Thiele used, made from the names of his uncles, Stanley, Clayton, George, and Douglas.   In the late 1960s Thiele was often brought in to produce artists on the company's Bluesway Records label.  He produced the albums that graduated B.B. King toward the mainstream, including 'Lucille' (1967).  He also produced BluesWay recordings by John Lee Hooker, T-Bone Walker, and others.   After seven years with ABC Records, the parent of Impulse!, Thiele formed his own company, Flying Dutchman Productions, in 1968.  Thiele later formed his own record label, Flying Dutchman Records, which is now part of Sony Music Entertainment.

But 1968 in the U.S. was turning out to be a very tumultuous year, with racial and political havoc added to the Vietnam War.  It was also a presidential election year.  Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy were both assassinated that spring and summer, and there was growing civil and racial unrest with urban riots and Viet Nam War protests.  Some thought Armstrong’s song could be a positive antidote for the troubled world of 1968.  In the midst of all this, songwriters Thiele and Weiss saw Armstrong as “the perfect ambassador to restore race relations” during America’s tumultuous summer.  Yet since the 1950s, Armstrong had been charged by some as being an “Uncle Tom,” catering to white America with his music.

Fishing and the removal of coral or artifacts is highly regulated.  Commercial shipping traffic is restricted to certain lanes that avoid the most sensitive parts of the park.  The park is a popular tourist destination and much of the management effort is directed at making sure these activities are ecologically sustainable.  Tourists can visit the reef on special glass bottomed boats or see it from the air by helicopter.  The most popular way to visit the reef, however, is by snorkelling or scuba diving.  Approximately two million people travel to the Great Barrier Reef each year which generates billions of dollars of economic activity for the region.  The Great Barrier Reef, along with many other coral reefs, is under threat from a number of environmental problems.
