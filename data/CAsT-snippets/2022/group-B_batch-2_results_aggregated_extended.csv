But instead, what is surprising is that the meat is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The asador moves the hot coal under the meat and adjusts the grill to regulate the temperatures for maximum juiciness.  This cooking technique on lower heat for long periods, transforms even the leanest of grass-fed meat into tender and delicious beauties.  The wait is long and the aromas can be painfully delicious.  6-  The Simpler The Sauce, The Better Argentinian Chimichurri sauce When you start with good products and the meat is cooked long and slow, you will find that you will rarely need to add any condiments to your meat.  Some salt and bay leaves would be fine.  In Argentina, the most popular sauce for Argentinian grilling is chimichurri.  This sauce is made of parsley, garlic, oregano, red pepper, vinegar, and olive oil.  The chimichurri can be put on top of the meat as a final touch just before eating.

That may be good news for grain farmers, but it's not a welcome change for the chefs of Buenos Aires.  'It's politics, not gastronomy,' says Javier Urondo, chef and owner of Urondo Bar and Restaurant in the Parque Chacubuco neighborhood.  Urondo would much rather buy grass-fed beef, but says it's impossible because the industry doesn't identify meat by production method.  'There's no way of knowing,' the affable 54-year-old told me over a late lunch at Bar Seis in the Palermo Soho neighborhood.  'Even my butcher doesn't know.'  And because the change has been gradual, Urondo says, most customers don't notice the difference.  (That thought was seconded in a September report on Argentina's beef production by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service.)

Afternoon tea became standard amongst large segments of the population and generated the popular 'merienda', an afternoon snack also known simply as 'la leche' (milk) because it was served with tea or chocolate milk along with sweets.
