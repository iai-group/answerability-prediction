Meanwhile, Congress intervened when the Senate organized the Watergate Committee to investigate the event.  Needless to say, the walls were closing in around Nixon, and it became much worse.  John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, was convicted of engaging in illegal activities by federal prosecutors.  When that information became public, Judge Sirica increased the pressure on the Watergate intruders.  In March, Sirica finally achieved his desired outcome when one of the intruders released information linking CREEP to the break-in.  The dominoes were now falling one by one.

Nixon lost all credibility when the “smoking gun” tape was subpoenaed by the Supreme Court.  On this particular tape, Nixon ordered the FBI off the case for matters of “national security.”  Following this discovery, even Nixon’s most loyal supporters on the House Judiciary Committee announced their decision to vote for impeachment once the matter was to reach the House floor.  As his public support evaporated, Nixon was forced to step down from office, thus delivering his speech of resignation.

Culeman-Beckman said Jacob Bernstein, the son of Carl Bernstein and Nora Ephron, had told him the name at summer camp in 1988, and that Jacob claimed he had been told by his father.  Felt said to the 'Courant', 'No, it's not me.  I would have done better.  I would have been more effective.  Deep Throat didn't exactly bring the White House crashing down, did he?' Bernstein said his son didn't know.  'Bob and I have been wise enough never to tell our wives, and we've certainly never told our children.'  (Bernstein reiterated on June 2, 2005, on the 'Today Show' that his wife had never known.)   Leonard Garment, President Nixon's former law partner who became White House counsel after John W. Dean's resignation, ruled Felt out as Deep Throat in his 2000 book 'In Search of Deep Throat'.  Garment wrote:  The Felt theory was a strong one ...  Felt had a personal motive for acting.
