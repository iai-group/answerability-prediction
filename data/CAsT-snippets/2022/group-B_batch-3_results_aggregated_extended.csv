They can be biased, just like their designers.  Thought Experiment Google search algorithms are not impartial.  They can be biased, just like their designers.  Search patterns matter because sites like Google are becoming increasingly powerful arbiters of public information.  Search results are not objective truths.  Philippe Huguen / AFP - Getty Images Feb. 21, 2018, 8:05 AM PST / Updated Feb. 21, 2018, 8:05 AM PST By Noah Berlatsky, cultural critic In 2010, communications scholar Safiya U. Noble was looking for websites to share with her stepdaughter and nieces.  She searched 'black girls' on Google, expecting to be directed to educational sites, historical information, or pop culture sites for young people.  Instead, the first hit was the site HotBlackPussy.com.  The first page was filled with similar results.  According to Google in 2010, 'black girls' were defined not by history, interests, or aspirations.  They were defined as porn.  What accounts for such racist, sexist search results?

Considering algorithms are, after all, lines of code, it is understandable why we might want to perceive them as unerring, impartial decision makers.  That is a tempting view — but it is also, experts say, incorrect.  As David Oppenheimer, a University of California at Berkeley law professor said about algorithms to the New York Times in 2015: “Even if they are not designed with the intent of discriminating against those groups, if they reproduce social preferences even in a completely rational way, they also reproduce those forms of discrimination.”",3.0,Are algorithms really biased against people of colour,"[{""answer_confidence"":{""high"":False,""low"":False,""medium"":False,""very_high"":True,""very_low"":False},""passage-snippets-annotation-qualification-task"":{""entities"":[{""endOffset"":1157,""label"":""relevant-text-span"",""startOffset"":947}]}}]",x,,"['Even if they are not designed with the intent of discriminating against those groups, if they reproduce social preferences even in a completely rational way, they also reproduce those forms of discrimination.']"

According to Raff in his opinion letter, search neutrality ought to be 'the principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance'.  On October 11, 2009, Adam and his wife Shivaun launched SearchNeutrality.org, an initiative dedicated to promoting investigations against Google's search engine practices.  There, the Raffs note that they chose to frame their issue with Google as 'search neutrality' in order to benefit from the focus and interest on net neutrality.   In contrast to net neutrality, answers to such questions, as 'what is search neutrality?' or 'what are appropriate legislative or regulatory principles to protect search neutrality?', appear to have less consensus.
